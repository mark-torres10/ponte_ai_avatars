# Ticket 002: ElevenLabs API Integration

**Title**: Integrate ElevenLabs streaming API for real-time audio generation
**Type**: Task
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 2 days
**Labels**: api-integration, audio, elevenlabs

## Description
Integrate the ElevenLabs streaming API to generate real-time audio responses for the Sports Commentator avatar. This will provide the audio component for the talking head demo.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ElevenLabs API client service created
- [ ] Streaming audio generation endpoint implemented
- [ ] Text-to-speech conversion working with sample text
- [ ] Audio quality meets demo requirements
- [ ] Error handling for API failures implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting and cost controls in place
- [ ] Audio streaming to frontend functional

## Technical Requirements
- ElevenLabs streaming API integration
- Audio streaming endpoint (`/api/audio/generate`)
- Audio quality configuration (44.1kHz, 16-bit)
- Error handling with fallback responses
- Basic rate limiting implementation
- Audio format validation and conversion

## Dependencies
- Ticket 001 (Project Setup and Basic Backend Infrastructure)

## Definition of Done
- Audio generation endpoint responds within 500ms
- Audio quality is clear and natural-sounding
- Error handling gracefully manages API failures
- Frontend can receive and play audio streams
- Ready for WebRTC integration

## Implementation Notes
- Use ElevenLabs streaming API for real-time audio generation
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Set up rate limiting to control costs
- Ensure audio quality meets demo requirements
- Test with various text inputs for quality validation

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] API endpoint responds successfully
- [ ] Audio quality is clear and natural
- [ ] Response time under 500ms
- [ ] Error handling works for API failures
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Audio streams correctly to frontend
