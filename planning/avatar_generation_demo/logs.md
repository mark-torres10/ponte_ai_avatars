# Avatar Generation Demo - Progress Logs

## Project Setup - 2025-07-30

### Completed
- ✅ Created comprehensive brain dump with all requirements
- ✅ Generated detailed specification document
- ✅ Created Linear project: "Avatar Generation Demo Implementation"
- ✅ Created 8 tickets (PON-18 through PON-25) with clear dependencies
- ✅ Set up project folder structure
- ✅ Created project tracking files (plan, todo, logs)

```

### Ticket Dependencies
- **PON-18**: Foundation (no dependencies)
- **PON-19, PON-20**: Can be done in parallel after PON-18
- **PON-21**: Depends on PON-18, PON-20
- **PON-22**: Depends on PON-19, PON-20, PON-21
- **PON-23**: Depends on PON-18, PON-22
- **PON-24, PON-25**: Can be done in parallel after PON-23

### Next Steps
- Await user instruction to begin implementation
- Start with PON-18 (backend setup) as foundation
- Follow incremental implementation order
- Use Playwright MCP for brand consistency verification

### Key Decisions Made
- Separate backend service (Express.js/TypeScript) for scalability
- Incremental implementation: OpenAI → ElevenLabs → D-ID
- Local storage for demo (no database integration)
- Professional loading states and error handling
- Brand consistency with existing MVP

### Risk Mitigation
- Clear error messages for each API service
- Loading states for all async operations
- Parallel execution where possible
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
