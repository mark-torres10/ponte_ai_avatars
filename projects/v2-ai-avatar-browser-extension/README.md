## Problem Statement

Sports fans currently consume sports content passively on ESPN NBA pages, missing contextual information that could enhance their understanding and engagement. The current extension (PON-76) only provides basic avatar detection without intelligent interaction or content delivery.

## Solution Vision

A polished, AI-powered browser extension that automatically detects NBA games on ESPN pages and provides proactive, engaging commentary with audio synthesis. The extension offers interactive dialogue options, Wikipedia team information, and professional-quality UI/UX that demonstrates the full potential of proactive AI assistants.

## Key Features

- **Enhanced ESPN Detection**: Sophisticated team extraction and game context analysis
- **AI-Powered Commentary**: OpenAI integration for contextual game recognition
- **Interactive Dialogue**: "Tell me more" vs "Good to know" options
- **Exa API Integration**: Intelligent, context-aware information retrieval
- **Audio Synthesis**: ElevenLabs integration with text synchronization
- **Professional UI/UX**: shadcn/ui components, smooth animations, modern design

## Technical Approach

- **Client-Side Only**: No backend required, direct API integration
- **Modern Tooling**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, performant state
- **Performance**: <100ms page load impact, 60fps animations

> **‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECTURE NOTE**: The current "Client-Side Only" approach is a temporary solution for rapid prototyping and demo purposes. In production, all AI services (OpenAI, ElevenLabs) should be moved to a secure backend service to protect API keys and improve security. This frontend-only approach prioritizes speed of delivery over production readiness.

## Success Criteria

- **Demo Quality**: Stakeholder-impressing UI/UX
- **Functionality**: Working ESPN detection, AI responses, audio
- **Polish**: Smooth animations, professional design
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days development for polished demo

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Day 1)**: Foundation setup, enhanced ESPN analysis, AI integration, dialogue system
- **Phase 2 (Day 2)**: Audio integration, Wikipedia integration, UI polish, testing and demo prep

## Dependencies

- OpenAI API access and credits
- ElevenLabs API access
- Exa API (AI-powered search and content retrieval)
- Chrome extension development environment

## Project Status

- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Project planning and specification complete
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Linear project created and tickets defined
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Project structure and tracking setup complete
- üîÑ **Phase 3.5**: File organization and project tracking setup in progress
- ‚è≥ **Phase 4**: Design and architecture planning (ready to begin)
- ‚è≥ **Phase 5**: Execution and delivery (tickets ready for implementation)
