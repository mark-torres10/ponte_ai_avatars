# Sports Commentator Talking Head Demo - Progress Logs

## Project Overview
**Project**: Sports Commentator Talking Head Demo  
**Start Date**: [TBD]  
**Target Completion**: [TBD + 4 weeks]  
**Status**: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation  

## Log Entries

### [Date] - Project Planning Complete
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Description**: Completed comprehensive project planning including:
- Brain dump session with user requirements
- Multi-persona specification review (Backend Architect: 8.5/10, Frontend Demo Expert: 8.0/10, Rapid Prototyper: 7.5/10)
- Detailed technical specification with WebRTC implementation and synchronization strategy
- Linear project definition and 12 detailed tickets
- Project folder structure and tracking files setup

**Key Decisions Made**:
- WebRTC with Socket.io for real-time communication
- Timestamp-based audio-video synchronization with <50ms tolerance
- 4-week implementation timeline with phased approach
- Basketball focus for demo simplicity
- LLM-powered responses with passionate commentator personality
- Admin-only access integrated into existing dashboard

**Next Steps**: Begin implementation with Ticket 001 (Project Setup and Basic Backend Infrastructure)

**Notes**: All planning documents are in place and ready for development team to begin work.

## Technical Decisions Log

### WebRTC Implementation
**Decision**: Use Socket.io for WebRTC signaling server  
**Rationale**: More reliable and easier to implement than native WebRTC signaling  
**Implementation**: Socket.io server with room-based session management  
**Status**: ✅ Planned  

### Audio-Video Synchronization
**Decision**: Timestamp-based synchronization with buffer management  
**Rationale**: Provides precise timing alignment with configurable tolerance  
**Implementation**: StreamSynchronizer class with jitter compensation  
**Status**: ✅ Planned  

### API Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Backend service coordination for all external APIs  
**Rationale**: Centralized control, security, and error handling  
**Implementation**: Express.js service coordinating ElevenLabs, D-ID, and OpenAI  
**Status**: ✅ Planned
