7:54am: Have meeting with the team. Some things I want to bring up include:
- First video I generated, and the tools I used and the research I did to see what other people are doing out there with their workflows.
- Creating the first "playbook"
- Best thing I can do is be a "workflow orchestrator" and figure out the skeleton of the playbook and ways to automate it, and then leave the details (e.g., what makes a TikTok a "good" TikTok?) to someone else.
- Ask them straight up if they're interested in continuing past the current 8 week engagement.

Have an interactive digital replica embedded in some sort of website or business so that instead of you statically interacting with a website, you can interact with an individual.

Step 1: Cameo-esque use case
Step 2: More complex ads
Step 3: Fully interactive digital replica
- e.g., have a chatbot but then instead of a person talking to a chatbot, they talk to the virtual avatar version.

- e.g., a talking head that chats to you in real time.

Something like Delphi (I sent them this earlier).
- https://www.heygen.com/interactive-avatar

I can take one of their use cases and ship a demo (they want to use the fishing rod example).
- Probably need to create a demo
- Then in reality this will likely be embedded as a JS plugin to a website.

They want an "interactive" shopping experience, an interactive avatar going with you to scroll the Internet.

Trying to help websites be less static and more human-like.

e.g., an avatar that can be pinned to a browser and it can accompany people in real time as they're scrolling through and giving comments (e.g., an ESPN commentator can have a talking head and then as you're scrolling ESPN, they'll pop up and give commentary on that game).

- V1 MVP: creating talking head.
- V2 MVP: same talking head, on ESPN.

8:42am: Oh lol, they want a talking head then. I'll ship an MVP of that. I'll see how much I can get done today.

I think what I'll do is make it fully interactive, with text + voice input.
- Something like what Mercor uses in their virtual interviews, bruh.

9:19am: I think I'll actually just piggyback off my existing avatar generation and just change the text passed to ElevenLabs, nice!

Then I think a V2 MVP is to add another profile to the /generate-avatar (just Parker again), but make it a "sports persona" where we can either (1) ask it what's the latest sports news (e.g., what happened in the latest X game) and/or (2) paste in a link to an ESPN game and the avatar will talk about it. A V3 MVP is adding audio integration, so you can "talk" to the avatar.

Ironically I think they want something like Cluely, but for sports.

This is what I sent to the team:
"""text
Here's an app that I think sounds similar to the end state that you're looking for, something like a real-time avatar to provide, for example, commentary: https://cluely.com/
 
They have a real-time "digital mind" that listens to your calls in real time and gives you real-time feedback and information.
 
If this is the idea that you're thinking of, there's definitely investor appetite for real-time, "always-on" AI avatars. Most AIs are reactive and only response after you ask them first; they don't also give commentary proactively. I've read a bunch of think pieces talking about how these "always-on AI avatars" are the next evolution of AI.
"""

10:11am: Lols, this V1 is now done, nice! (at least the UI is).
- I'll vibe code V1 to completion today.
- Simultaneously, I'll start planning out the V2 and V3.

11:50am: Okay, I said that I would just skip this v1 and I would just go straight to the v3 immediately. Just having a talking head that you can talk to and I'll just do it all one shot in one go, no need to do it in a piecemeal way like we had it before. I'm just gonna do that, and that'll be my goal to finish by the end of this 4-week engagement I have left with them. I already scoped it out, and I think it will take me like 3-4 days of just being locked in. So I'll have to find time to do that, but that time is not today.
