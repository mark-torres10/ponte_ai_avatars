## 5. Technical Feasibility and Estimation

### Technical Architecture
```
Frontend (React/Next.js)
    ↓ WebRTC
Backend Service (Express/Node.js)
    ↓ API Calls
├── ElevenLabs API (Audio Generation)
├── D-ID API (Video Generation)  
├── OpenAI API (LLM Responses)
└── WebRTC Signaling Server (Socket.io)
```

### WebRTC Implementation Details
- **Signaling Server**: Socket.io for reliable WebRTC signaling
- **STUN Servers**: Google's free STUN servers for NAT traversal
- **Peer Connection**: RTCPeerConnection with ICE candidate handling
- **Data Channels**: Real-time communication for audio/video coordination

### Audio-Video Synchronization Strategy
- **Timestamp-Based Sync**: Precise timing alignment using chunk timestamps
- **Buffer Management**: Overflow protection with configurable buffer sizes
- **Jitter Compensation**: Dynamic buffer sizing based on network conditions
- **Sync Threshold**: 50ms tolerance for audio-video alignment

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Basic API integrations and backend service
2. **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: WebRTC implementation and real-time audio streaming
3. **Phase 3 (Week 3)**: Video integration and audio-video synchronization
4. **Phase 4 (Week 4)**: Polish, testing, and investor readiness

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Audio-video synchronization complexity (mitigated with timestamp-based strategy)
- **Medium Risk**: WebRTC implementation and browser compatibility (mitigated with Socket.io and fallbacks)
- **Low Risk**: API integrations and basic functionality

### Resource Requirements
- **Development**: 1 full-stack developer (4 weeks)
- **APIs**: ElevenLabs, D-ID, OpenAI accounts and keys
- **Infrastructure**: Backend hosting, WebRTC signaling server
- **Testing**: Browser compatibility testing, performance optimization
