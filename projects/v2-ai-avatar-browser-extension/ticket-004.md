        <div>Test content</div>
      </DialoguePopup>
    );
    
    const popup = getByTestId('dialogue-popup');
    expect(popup).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(popup).toHaveClass('top-right');
  });
  
  test('should animate on mount/unmount', () => {
    const { rerender } = render(
      <DialoguePopup isVisible={true} position="top-right">
        <div>Test content</div>
      </DialoguePopup>
    );
    
    // Test entrance animation
    const popup = screen.getByTestId('dialogue-popup');
    expect(popup).toHaveClass('animate-in');
    
    // Test exit animation
    rerender(
      <DialoguePopup isVisible={false} position="top-right">
        <div>Test content</div>
      </DialoguePopup>
    );
    
    expect(popup).toHaveClass('animate-out');
  });
});
```

**Manual Verification Steps**:
1. **Load Extension on ESPN Page**
   - Navigate to ESPN NBA boxscore page (e.g., https://www.espn.com/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/401705278)
   - Wait for page to load completely
   - Look for AI avatar in top-right corner (should appear automatically)
   
2. **Test Dialogue Popup Appearance**
   - Click the avatar once
   - Verify new professional dialogue popup appears (replaces old overlay)
   - Check that popup has modern, polished appearance with rounded corners
   - Confirm popup is positioned correctly in top-right area
   
3. **Test Responsive Positioning**
   - Resize browser window to different sizes (mobile: 375x667, tablet: 768x1024, desktop: 1920x1080)
   - Verify popup positioning adapts correctly to screen size
   - Confirm popup remains visible and properly positioned
   
4. **Test Animation Smoothness**

#### **Step 2.2: StreamingText Component (60 minutes)**
**Implementation**: Create real-time text streaming with smooth character-by-character animation

**Files to Create**:
- `src/components/StreamingText/StreamingText.tsx` - Streaming logic
- `src/components/StreamingText/index.tsx` - Export file
- `src/components/StreamingText/types.ts` - Component types

**Component Features & Design Rationale**:

**Character-by-Character Text Streaming Effect**
- **Why**: This creates the illusion of "live" AI generation happening in real-time, which is crucial for stakeholder demonstrations. It shows the AI is actively working and generating content, rather than just displaying pre-written text. This effect immediately communicates technological sophistication and engagement.
- **Implementation**: Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps character rendering, with configurable timing intervals that create natural, human-like typing rhythm. Each character appears with a subtle fade-in effect that feels organic and engaging.

**Intelligent Streaming Speed Control (5-25 characters per second)**
- **Why**: Different stakeholders have different reading speeds and preferences. Fast streaming (20-25 cps) creates excitement and shows technical capability, while slower streaming (5-10 cps) allows for better comprehension and creates anticipation. This customization demonstrates user-centric thinking.
- **Implementation**: Adaptive speed system that adjusts based on text complexity, user preferences, and demo context. Include preset speeds (slow, normal, fast) with smooth transitions between them.

**Smooth Typing Animations with Framer Motion**
- **Why**: Framer Motion provides optimized animation performance that ensures smooth 60fps rendering even during complex text animations. This performance is critical for stakeholder impression as it demonstrates technical excellence and attention to detail.
- **Implementation**: Use Framer Motion's optimized variants for character entrance animations, with staggered timing that creates natural typing flow. Implement spring physics for natural movement that feels responsive and polished.

**Advanced Loading States and Completion Callbacks**
- **Why**: Loading states provide user feedback and create anticipation, while completion callbacks enable sophisticated interactions like automatic action button reveals or follow-up animations. This demonstrates the system's ability to handle complex user experience flows.
- **Implementation**: Multiple loading states (connecting, generating, streaming) with smooth transitions between them. Completion callbacks trigger next-phase interactions, creating a seamless flow that feels like a complete AI conversation.

**Performance Optimization for 60fps Rendering**
- **Why**: Maintaining 60fps during text streaming is crucial for professional impression. Smooth animations demonstrate technical capability and create a premium feel that stakeholders will notice and appreciate.
- **Implementation**: Use React.memo for component optimization, implement virtual scrolling for very long texts, and use CSS transforms instead of layout changes for animations. Monitor performance with requestAnimationFrame timing to ensure consistent frame rates.

**Automated Tests**:
```typescript
describe('StreamingText Component', () => {
  test('should stream text character by character', async () => {
    const onComplete = jest.fn();
    render(
      <StreamingText 
        text="Hello World" 
        speed={10} 
        onComplete={onComplete}
        isStreaming={true}
      />
    );
    
    // Wait for streaming to complete
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Hello World')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    
    expect(onComplete).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
  
  test('should handle different streaming speeds', () => {
    const { rerender } = render(
      <StreamingText text="Test" speed={5} isStreaming={true} />
    );
    
    // Test fast speed
    rerender(<StreamingText text="Test" speed={20} isStreaming={true} />);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('streaming-text')).toHaveAttribute('data-speed', '20');
  });
});
```

**Manual Verification Steps**:
1. **Test Text Streaming Effect**
   - Click avatar to open dialogue popup
   - Verify text begins streaming character-by-character
   - Check that streaming speed feels natural (not too fast or slow)
   - Confirm each character appears smoothly without stuttering
   
2. **Test Performance at 60fps**
   - Open DevTools Performance tab
   - Generate new commentary to trigger streaming
   - Verify frame rate maintains 60fps during text streaming
   - Check that no frame drops occur during animation
   
3. **Test Different Text Lengths**
   - Generate commentary multiple times to get different text lengths
   - Verify streaming works smoothly for short, medium, and long text
   - Confirm completion callback triggers properly for all lengths
   
4. **Test Streaming Speed Control**
   - Look for streaming speed controls in dialogue settings
   - Adjust speed between slow, normal, and fast
   - Verify streaming speed changes immediately
   - Confirm different speeds feel appropriate

#### **Step 2.3: ActionButtons Component (45 minutes)**
**Implementation**: Create interactive button system for user choices with smooth animations

**Files to Create**:
- `src/components/ActionButtons/ActionButtons.tsx` - Button system
- `src/components/ActionButtons/index.tsx` - Export file
- `src/components/ActionButtons/types.ts` - Component types

**Component Features & Design Rationale**:

**Professional Button System Using shadcn/ui Components**
- **Why**: shadcn/ui Button components provide enterprise-grade quality and consistency that immediately signals professional software development. This creates visual harmony with the DialoguePopup and demonstrates attention to design system consistency.
- **Implementation**: Extend shadcn/ui Button components with custom variants and animations, ensuring all buttons maintain the professional appearance while adding sports-themed styling that fits the ESPN context.

**Strategic Button Variant System (primary, secondary, danger)**
- **Why**: Different button variants communicate different levels of importance and action types. Primary buttons (like "Generate Commentary") are the main actions, secondary buttons (like "Change Style") are supportive actions, and danger buttons (like "Stop Generation") are cautionary actions. This hierarchy demonstrates thoughtful UX design.
- **Implementation**: Use CSS custom properties for consistent variant styling, with smooth transitions between states. Each variant has distinct visual weight and color coding that guides user attention appropriately.

**Smooth Hover and Click Animations with Framer Motion**
- **Why**: Smooth animations provide immediate visual feedback that makes the interface feel responsive and polished. Hover animations (scale, shadow, color transitions) create engagement, while click animations (press effect, ripple) provide confirmation. This level of polish is crucial for stakeholder impression.
- **Implementation**: Use Framer Motion's whileHover and whileTap variants for smooth state transitions. Implement spring physics for natural movement that feels responsive and professional. Ensure all animations maintain 60fps performance.

**Comprehensive Keyboard Navigation Support (Tab, Enter, Space)**
- **Why**: Professional software must be fully accessible via keyboard for users with disabilities and for power users who prefer keyboard navigation. This demonstrates the team's commitment to inclusive design and professional software development practices.
- **Implementation**: Full keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators, logical tab order, and proper ARIA attributes. Support for Enter and Space key activation, with clear visual feedback for keyboard users.

**Intelligent Layout System (horizontal, vertical, grid)**
- **Why**: Different button arrangements are optimal for different contexts. Horizontal layouts work well for simple choices, vertical layouts for longer lists, and grid layouts for complex option sets. This flexibility demonstrates thoughtful design and adaptability.
- **Implementation**: CSS Grid-based layout system that automatically adapts to button count and content. Smooth transitions between layout modes, ensuring optimal button spacing and visual hierarchy regardless of arrangement.

**Advanced Accessibility Features (ARIA labels, screen reader support)**
- **Why**: Accessibility is not just a legal requirement but a mark of professional software quality. Screen reader support, proper ARIA labels, and semantic HTML demonstrate technical sophistication and inclusive design thinking that stakeholders will appreciate.
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive ARIA implementation including labels, descriptions, and state announcements. Screen reader testing with NVDA (Windows) and VoiceOver (Mac) to ensure full compatibility. Semantic HTML structure that supports assistive technologies.

**Automated Tests**:

#### **Step 2.4: Integration Layer (30 minutes)**
**Implementation**: Connect dialogue components with existing commentary system

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/stores/dialogueStore.ts` - New dialogue state management
- `src/content-script.ts` - Integration with existing commentary system

**Integration Features & Design Rationale**:

**Seamless State Management Extension**
- **Why**: The dialogue UI must integrate seamlessly with the existing commentary system without breaking current functionality. This demonstrates technical skill in system evolution and shows the team's ability to enhance existing systems gracefully rather than rebuilding from scratch.
- **Implementation**: Extend the existing ContentScriptState interface with dialogue-specific properties, ensuring backward compatibility. Use the same state update patterns and lifecycle management that the existing system already employs.

**Intelligent Component Communication System**
- **Why**: The dialogue components need to communicate with the existing commentary generation system to display real-time updates, handle user interactions, and maintain state consistency. This creates a unified user experience that feels like a single, cohesive system rather than separate components.
- **Implementation**: Implement a pub/sub pattern for component communication, allowing dialogue components to subscribe to commentary state changes and respond appropriately. Use React Context for state sharing and ensure all updates are atomic and consistent.

**Smooth State Transition Management**
- **Why**: Users should experience seamless transitions between different dialogue states (loading, streaming, complete, error) without jarring visual changes. This smoothness is crucial for professional impression and demonstrates attention to user experience detail.
- **Implementation**: Use Framer Motion's AnimatePresence for smooth component transitions, with carefully timed state updates that coordinate with animation durations. Implement loading states that prevent user confusion during transitions.

**Backward Compatibility Preservation**
- **Why**: Existing users and functionality must continue to work exactly as before. This demonstrates the team's commitment to maintaining system stability while adding new features, which is crucial for stakeholder confidence in the team's technical capabilities.
- **Implementation**: Maintain all existing commentary overlay functionality alongside the new dialogue system. Use feature flags to enable/disable new features, ensuring the old system remains fully functional during the transition period.

**Performance-Optimized Integration**
- **Why**: Adding new UI components must not degrade the performance of the existing commentary system. This demonstrates the team's ability to add features without compromising system quality, which is essential for maintaining stakeholder confidence.
- **Implementation**: Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations, implement lazy loading for dialogue components, and ensure all new animations use CSS transforms instead of layout changes. Monitor performance metrics to ensure no degradation.

**Automated Tests**:
```typescript
describe('Dialogue Integration', () => {
  test('should integrate with existing commentary system', () => {
    // Test that dialogue state updates when commentary generates
    const store = useDialogueStore();
    store.setCommentaryText('Test commentary');
    
    expect(store.currentText).toBe('Test commentary');
    expect(store.isStreaming).toBe(true);
  });
  
  test('should maintain existing functionality', () => {
    // Test that old commentary overlay still works
    const oldOverlay = document.querySelector('.commentary-overlay');
    expect(oldOverlay).toBeDefined();
    
    // Test that new dialogue appears alongside
    const dialogue = document.querySelector('[data-testid="dialogue-popup"]');
    expect(dialogue).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

**Manual Verification Steps**:
1. **Test Integration with Commentary**
   - Click avatar to generate commentary
