## Key Decisions and Insights

### Technical Decisions
- **Authentication Provider**: Clerk (hosted components)
- **Database**: Supabase with users table
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Component Integration**: Leverage existing talent onboarding flow
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom Hooks

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Use Clerk's hosted components to reduce integration complexity
- Leverage existing onboarding components to minimize development time
- Implement comprehensive testing from the start
- Follow Next.js App Router patterns for consistency

### Success Metrics
- Authentication success rate: >95%
- Role assignment accuracy: 100%
- Route protection: 100% of unauthorized access blocked
- Testing coverage: >90% for authentication components

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation with Ticket-001 (Clerk integration)
2. Set up development environment and dependencies
3. Configure Clerk and Supabase accounts
4. Start with foundation components and build up

## Notes and Observations
- Project leverages existing talent onboarding flow effectively
- Testing strategy is comprehensive and well-defined
- Component composition patterns will ensure maintainability
- Role-based access control is critical for marketplace functionality
