- Looks like I can just create agents (with custom voices) in the ElevenLabs UI itself, so that all storage and whatnot is managed there. That does help me quite a bit and saves me from having to set up that storage myself manually (I'll probably still have a Supabase use case later, but I can start with this).
- I can store the voices in ElevenLabs for now.
- Off-the-shelf solutions to consider (frankly better than building this myself, but can explore later):
    - https://www.aistudios.com/ (looks great but is kinda pricey?)
    - https://hourone.ai/ (does full-body avatars, but really pricey, clearly for more enterprise-ish stuff)
    - https://synthesia.io (the one that the PonteAI team mentioned. There is full body, but it's kinda clunky. Even their demo feels AI-generated).
- So, there are things that clearly exist, but these are more for enterprise-worthy stuff. What about for smaller creators? Or something curated for creators specifically?
- I suppose this doesn't change me creating the MVP.

- I think I can start with D-ID and see how the quality looks and review with the team. If we want better videos, we can move to HeyGen for more polish.
- NOTE: Looks like I can do the frontend in Vercel and my backend with n8n. AMAZING.
- OK, I think that would work well. Plus it's easily extensible and lets me ship quickly.

- I created the V4 spec to update the MVP, but now I'm thinking that I want to just create this with n8n and start using that.

- OK, I think to start, what I can do is:
    - Set up n8n to just create the ElevenLabs audio
    - Have two possible audios

- I cloned the two voices (Voice A = Terry Crews, Voice B = Will Howard) into ElevenLabs. Now need to actually set up the audio recording.

- Now setting up the n8n pipeline. I'm setting up JWT Auth with Supabase, and then fixing the flow logic. At minimum, the audio files are now saved to Supabase storage, so at least that's taken cared of now.
- I also need to move stuff in n8n to secrets, can't just be leaking secrets willy-nilly ofc.

- OK, I've built a first pass of an audio pipeline via n8n that can easily create audio and save to Supabase.
    - I need to create a more cleaned-up version of the e2e pipeline that can (1) save the audio file to blob storage and (2) save metadata.
    - Then, I need to do the JWT auth, just to make sure that logins and requests to the endpoint are secure.
    
2:33pm: OK, I've created the cleaned-up version of the e2e pipeline. Nice! Now time to set up the JWT auth. Then once that's done, I can start creating the video pipeline with D-ID. I'll probably have to grab a few sample pictures and put it up in Google Drive.

Once all this backend stuff is done, it's just a matter of doing the frontend in Vercel then and making it look nice, because the backend will be set. Nice!

Gotta make sure I don't finish this too fast lol.

2:57pm: OK, annoyingly it looks like I need to configure a frontend that will have the login logic. I suppose I can build a "Hello World" with a login page. I think I can just do a simple Vercel app and then have an /app/login page. I also need to see how to connect this to the Lovable website later.

Currently I can just have the Vercel app and build with that, then connect later (ChatGPT says the easiest way is to use app.ponteai.com).

6:12pm: OK, frontend with login and Hello World example is done. Now we can enable JWT auth. Simultaneously, I'm working on the video generation stuff.

I think for the JWT auth, I can test that separately (i.e., it doesn't have to trigger any of the downstream nodes). I can have it take a request payload and then ping the n8n backend and then just look at what the request is, to see if it would've propagated the correct values (e.g., avatar, text, etc).

Right now I'm working on the D-ID integration.

6:46pm: Annoyingly, n8n doesn't let me send the HTTP request to D-ID correctly? So I'm creating a Supabase edge function to manage this.

6:54pm: Fixing the JWT auth on the edge function. I need to run the app myself, grab the JWT token from the console log (yes, not very secure, but it just gets me what I need), and then use that in the auth.

6:55pm: Actually, let me try this without JWT, just to see if this approach even works.

7:14pm: OK, looks like the "Circular JSON" thing wasn't n8n at all, but rather not being able to actually access the Supabase files??? I verified this by creating a public Supabase bucket, adding the previous picture and MP3 from the demo, and seeing if it works. 

7:37pm: I'm about to finish the first pass of audio + video. But there's still a bit to implement. I need to:
- Add JWT auth.
- Fix up any hanging hardcoded vars (shouldn't be any, but need to check).
- Add correct login.

But the backend stuff is mostly set. This should also have been the hardest part TBH, and from this point onwards hopefully it'll be easier.

I'm really wondering if it would've been better just to code this up myself, instead of using n8n, since I do have coding agents that can exponentially increase my velocity.

TBH maybe tomorrow I'll rewrite the whole dang thing myself without n8n, this was annoyingly brutal with using n8n after all.

Maybe I'll just build off the demo that I already had and just add in all these functionalities. I suppose I already have Supabase set up, so that's good.
