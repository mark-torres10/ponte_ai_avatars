# Sports Inc. NBA Boxscore Replica - Lessons Learned

## Project Planning Phase

### What Worked Well
- **Playwright MCP Analysis**: Excellent tool for examining live websites and extracting detailed technical information
- **Structured Planning**: Following the PROJECT_PLANNING_EXECUTION_OUTLINE.md provided clear direction
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Creating detailed analysis notes early prevented information loss
- **Linear Integration**: Creating tickets with detailed acceptance criteria ensures clear deliverables

### Key Insights
- **Visual Accuracy Requirements**: Pixel-perfect replication requires meticulous attention to detail
- **Asset Management**: Need to plan for logo creation and image optimization early
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Essential for ensuring consistent experience across platforms
- **Accessibility**: Must be considered from the beginning, not as an afterthought

### Technical Learnings
- **ESPN's Design**: Uses modern CSS techniques with system fonts and responsive design
- **Performance Considerations**: Static site approach will help achieve fast load times
- **Asset Optimization**: Multiple logo sizes needed for different contexts
- **Semantic HTML**: ESPN uses proper semantic markup which we should replicate

### Process Improvements
- **Early Asset Planning**: Should create branding assets before implementation begins
- **Visual Comparison Tools**: Need automated tools for pixel-perfect comparison
- **Testing Strategy**: Should implement testing throughout development, not just at the end
- **Documentation**: Keep technical notes updated throughout implementation

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Regular Comparisons**: Compare with original ESPN page frequently during development
- **Early Testing**: Test on multiple browsers and devices throughout development
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor load times and optimize continuously
- **Accessibility Audits**: Regular accessibility testing during development

### Future Considerations
- **Maintenance**: Plan for updates if ESPN changes their design
- **Scalability**: Consider how to handle multiple games/pages
- **Legal**: Ensure compliance with any copyright or trademark considerations
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for future developers
