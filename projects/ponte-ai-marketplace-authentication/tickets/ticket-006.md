# PON-53: Restructure app layout with dedicated pages and admin navigation

## Context & Motivation
The current app has everything consolidated on the main page, but we need to restructure the layout to provide dedicated pages for each user role with proper navigation. This ticket moves each section to its own component/page and implements a navbar for admin users to switch between client dashboard and avatar generation. This restructuring improves user experience, navigation clarity, and role-based feature access.

Reference: Current implementation in `src/app/page.tsx` and role-based routing from PON-50

## Detailed Description & Requirements

#### Functional Requirements:
- **Home Page**: Clean main homepage with landing content only
- **Login Page**: Dedicated login page with Clerk authentication
- **Talent Page**: Display talent onboarding wizard components (direct routing from role selection)
- **Client Page**: Display client onboarding form components (direct routing from role selection)
- **Admin Page**: Implement navbar navigation between:
  - Client dashboard view
  - Generate avatar endpoint (`/generate-avatar`)
- **Navigation**: Remove consolidated layout, implement role-specific navigation
- **Route Protection**: Maintain existing middleware-based route protection
- **Role Selection**: Route users directly to role-specific pages (`/talent`, `/client`, `/admin`)

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Maintain existing authentication and role-based access control
- Preserve all existing functionality and data flows
- Ensure smooth page transitions and loading states
- Follow established component composition patterns
- Maintain responsive design across all pages
- Preserve existing error handling and validation

#### Validation & Error Handling:
- Handle navigation state management for admin navbar
- Maintain route protection for unauthorized access
- Preserve authentication state across page transitions
- Handle loading states during page navigation
- Ensure proper error boundaries for each page

## Success Criteria
- Home page displays only landing content without role-specific features
- Login page provides dedicated authentication interface
- Talent page shows onboarding wizard components
- Client page shows onboarding form components
- Admin page includes functional navbar for switching between views
- Role selection routes users directly to appropriate pages (`/talent`, `/client`, `/admin`)
- All existing functionality preserved and working
- Route protection continues to work correctly
- Navigation is intuitive and role-appropriate
- Page transitions are smooth and responsive
