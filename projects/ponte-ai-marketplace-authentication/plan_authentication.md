# Authentication System Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Implement comprehensive authentication system for Ponte AI marketplace app with role-based access control, leveraging existing onboarding components and modern authentication patterns.

## Subtasks and Deliverables

### Week 1: Foundation & Setup
- [ ] **Ticket-001**: Set up Clerk authentication integration (3 hours)
  - Install and configure `@clerk/nextjs@latest`
  - Create middleware with `clerkMiddleware()`
  - Wrap app with `<ClerkProvider>`
  - Configure OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft)
  - Test basic authentication flow

- [ ] **Ticket-002**: Create Supabase users table and database schema (2 hours)
  - Set up Supabase project and connection
  - Create users table with proper schema
  - Implement database constraints and indexes
  - Create migration files
  - Set up user data synchronization triggers

### Week 2: Authentication & Routing
- [ ] **Ticket-003**: Implement role-based routing and access control (3 hours)
  - Create role-based middleware for route protection
  - Implement role validation and assignment logic
  - Create dashboard pages for each role (/talent, /client, /admin)
  - Implement redirect logic for authenticated users
  - Add error handling for unauthorized access

### Week 3: Component Integration
- [ ] **Ticket-004**: Integrate existing onboarding components with authentication (4 hours)
  - Analyze existing talent onboarding wizard components
  - Analyze existing client onboarding form components
  - Create authentication integration layer for onboarding flows
  - Implement role assignment during onboarding process
  - Connect onboarding completion with user role assignment
  - Test complete onboarding flows with authentication

### Week 4: Testing & Polish
- [ ] **Ticket-005**: Implement Jest testing framework and comprehensive testing strategy (3 hours)
  - Set up Jest with React Testing Library
  - Implement Clerk webhook testing
  - Create role-based routing tests
  - Implement component testing for onboarding flows
  - Set up test coverage reporting
  - Optimize test performance and reliability

## Effort Estimates
- **Total Estimated Effort**: 15 hours
- **Week 1**: 5 hours (Foundation & Setup)
- **Week 2**: 3 hours (Authentication & Routing)
- **Week 3**: 4 hours (Component Integration)
- **Week 4**: 3 hours (Testing & Polish)

## Dependencies and Critical Path
1. **Ticket-001** (Clerk integration) must be completed first
2. **Ticket-002** (Supabase setup) can be done in parallel with Ticket-001
3. **Ticket-003** (role-based routing) depends on both Ticket-001 and Ticket-002
4. **Ticket-004** (onboarding integration) depends on Ticket-003
5. **Ticket-005** (testing) depends on all previous tickets

## Risk Mitigation
- **Clerk Integration Complexity**: Use official documentation and hosted components
- **Existing Component Integration**: Leverage existing talent onboarding flow
- **Testing Coverage**: Implement comprehensive testing strategy from the start
- **Role Synchronization**: Implement proper error handling and validation

## Success Criteria
- Users can sign up and log in with email, Google, and Microsoft
- Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access
- Existing onboarding components work seamlessly with authentication
- Comprehensive testing with 90%+ coverage for authentication components
- All authentication flows work end-to-end without errors
- Code is ready for deployment to production
