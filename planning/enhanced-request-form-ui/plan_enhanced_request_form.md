## Effort Estimates

**Total Project Duration**: 10-15 days
- Phase 1: 2-3 days (foundation)
- Phase 2: 2-3 days (parallel development)
- Phase 3: 2-3 days (parallel development)
- Phase 4: 2-3 days (completion)

## Success Criteria
- Multi-step wizard functions smoothly with back/forward navigation
- Avatar selection is visually clear and persistent
- Script templates provide clear guidance for each use case
- Form data is properly validated and submitted
- Progress is saved and recoverable
- Success page provides clear next steps
- Code is structured for easy Supabase integration

## Risk Mitigation
- **Complex state management**: Use React context and localStorage
- **Avatar selection confusion**: Clear visual feedback and help text
- **Backend integration**: API-first design with proper error handling
- **Form abandonment**: Progress persistence and recovery
