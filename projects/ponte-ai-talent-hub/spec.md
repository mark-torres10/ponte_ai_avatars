# ðŸ§¾ Spec: Ponte AI - AI Avatar Marketplace

## 1. Problem Statement
Ponte AI currently has a manual, email-based process for clients to book AI avatars, which creates friction and inefficiency. The internal team needs a professional frontend application to demonstrate to potential investors and clients, enabling them to raise funding and showcase their platform capabilities. This MVP will replace the manual email workflow with a streamlined web interface.

**Stakeholders affected:**
- Clients wanting to book AI avatars (primary users)
- Internal Ponte AI team (for client demos and fundraising)
- Potential investors (viewing the platform)

**Strategic alignment:** Core to business strategy for fundraising and client acquisition.

## 2. Desired Outcomes & Metrics
**Success criteria:**
- Deployed Vercel app accessible to stakeholders
- Professional, brand-consistent interface matching Ponte AI website
- Functional request-talent flow with avatar selection and form submission
- Non-technical stakeholders can successfully navigate and use the app
- Ready for client demonstrations and fundraising presentations

**Acceptance criteria:**
- All 4 routes render correctly (/, /request-talent, /onboard-client, /generate-avatar)
- Avatar carousel displays 5 example avatars with manual navigation
- Form submission shows confirmation message
- Responsive design works on standard devices
- Brand styling matches Ponte AI website

## 3. In Scope / Out of Scope
**In Scope:**
- Next.js 14+ app with App Router
- 4 main pages (home, request-talent, onboard-client stub, generate-avatar stub)
- Avatar carousel with 5 placeholder avatars
- Free-form intake form with submission confirmation
- Brand-consistent styling using Tailwind CSS
- ShadCN UI components where applicable
- Vercel deployment

**Out of Scope:**
- Backend functionality or API integration
- User authentication or user management
- Payment processing
- Database integration
- Analytics or tracking
- Email functionality
- Real avatar booking processing

## 4. Stakeholders & Dependencies
**Primary stakeholders:**
- Clients booking avatars (end users)
- Internal Ponte AI team (for demos and fundraising)
- Potential investors (viewing platform capabilities)

**Dependencies:**
- Ponte AI website design system (for brand consistency)
- Vercel deployment platform
- ShadCN UI component library

**No external team dependencies or sign-offs required.**

## 5. Risks / Unknowns
**Technical risks:**
- Brand asset extraction from Ponte AI website (mitigation: use Playwright MCP)
- Component library compatibility (mitigation: use established ShadCN)

**Timeline risks:**
- Single-day delivery constraint (mitigation: focus on MVP scope only)

**No known unknowns requiring research spikes.**

## 6. UX Notes & Accessibility
**User journey changes:**
- Current: Email-based manual process
- New: Web-based self-service flow with avatar selection and form submission

**UI requirements:**
- Match Ponte AI website styling (dark theme, pink accents, rounded elements)
- Responsive design for standard devices
- Clear navigation between routes
- Intuitive avatar selection and form submission

**Design system:**
- Use ShadCN components for consistency
- Extract brand colors and styling from Ponte AI website
- Maintain visual hierarchy and spacing

**Accessibility:** Standard web accessibility practices, no specific requirements beyond basics.

## 7. Technical Notes
**Implementation approach:**
- Next.js 14+ with App Router for modern React patterns
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom brand theme
- ShadCN UI components for consistency
- TypeScript for type safety
- Component-based architecture supporting future backend integration

**Architecture considerations:**
- Structure code to support future backend integration
- Use proper state management patterns for form handling
- Implement responsive design patterns
- Follow Next.js best practices for routing and components

**Extensibility:**
- Form submission handlers ready for API integration
- Component structure supporting data fetching
- Routing structure supporting additional features

## 8. Compliance, Cost, GTM
**Compliance:** No specific requirements for MVP.

**Cost:** Vercel deployment costs only (minimal for static site).

**GTM implications:**
- Professional presentation for fundraising
- Client demonstration capability
- Platform credibility and brand consistency

**Launch coordination:** Immediate deployment for stakeholder access.

## 9. Success Criteria
**Measurable definition of "done":**
- âœ… Deployed Vercel app accessible via URL
- âœ… All 4 routes render without errors
- âœ… Avatar carousel displays 5 avatars with manual navigation
- âœ… Form submission shows confirmation message
- âœ… Brand styling matches Ponte AI website
