## Ticket Dependencies and Parallel Execution

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **Ticket 001** and **Ticket 002** can be developed in parallel
- **Ticket 004** can be developed alongside **Ticket 002** and **Ticket 003**

### Critical Path
1. **Ticket 001** (Extension Foundation) - Must complete first
2. **Ticket 002** (Backend API) - Can start in parallel with Ticket 001
3. **Ticket 003** (Avatar UI) - Depends on both Ticket 001 and Ticket 002
4. **Ticket 004** (Content Detection) - Can be developed in parallel
5. **Ticket 005** (Testing) - Depends on all previous tickets

### Risk Mitigation
- Start Ticket 002 early to avoid API integration delays
- Develop Ticket 004 in parallel to ensure content detection works
- Allocate extra time for Ticket 003 (UI/Audio integration) as it's complex
- Keep Ticket 005 focused on testing and refinement, not new features
