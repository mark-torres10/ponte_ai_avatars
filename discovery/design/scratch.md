# Scratch pad notes
- Note that we don't actually need the dashboard for the admin view and the review form in the first v1. We can do that as a nice-to-have later on, but right now the goal is to track these via Sheets or Docs.
- We can create the entire app including the request form and request flow, and then do the AI component later.
