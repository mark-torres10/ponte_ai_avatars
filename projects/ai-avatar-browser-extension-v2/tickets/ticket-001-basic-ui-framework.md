# Ticket 001: Basic UI Framework Implementation

## Title
Implement Basic UI Framework with Feature Navigation

## Description
Create the foundational UI framework that allows users to click the avatar icon and see the 6 feature modes with hover effects. This ticket establishes the core interface that all other features will build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Avatar icon appears in browser toolbar
- [x] Clicking avatar reveals main popup interface (400x600px)
- [x] Header with "Parker Sports" branding and lightning bolt icon
- [x] 6 feature icons in 2x3 grid on right side of header:
  - Top row: Speech bubble (filled), Flame, Target/bullseye
  - Bottom row: Play button, Speech bubble (outline), Wi-Fi/radiating waves
- [x] Main content area shows "Debate Mode" with question mark help icon
- [x] Large light blue-gray interaction box with microphone instructions
- [x] Central black circular microphone button (80px diameter)
- [x] "Go Easy" (selected) and "Go Savage" difficulty toggle buttons
- [x] Keyboard icon with "Or type your question" text
- [x] Hover effects on all interactive elements
- [x] Smooth transitions and animations
- [x] Clean, modern design using shadcn-ui components

## Technical Requirements
- Use React with TypeScript
- Implement shadcn-ui components (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and layout
- Popup dimensions: 400px width x 600px height
- Color scheme: White background, dark text, light blue-gray (#E5E7EB) for interaction box
- Icon library: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- State management for mode switching and difficulty selection
- Ensure accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Optimize for performance (<200ms load time)
- Follow Chrome extension popup best practices

## User Story
As a sports fan, I want to click on the avatar icon and see all available features so that I can easily navigate to the mode I want to use.

## Definition of Done
- [x] Main popup interface matches the design exactly
- [x] All 6 feature icons are properly positioned and styled
- [x] Lightning bolt icon is highlighted to show active mode
- [x] Difficulty toggle buttons work with proper visual states
- [x] Microphone button and interaction box are properly styled
- [x] All hover effects work smoothly
- [x] Design matches the provided screenshot exactly
- [x] Code is properly documented with TypeScript types
- [x] No accessibility issues (keyboard navigation works)
- [x] Performance requirements met (<200ms load time)
- [x] Code review completed
- [x] Testing completed with all interactive elements

## Dependencies
- Chrome extension manifest setup
- Basic React component structure
- shadcn-ui component library
- Tailwind CSS configuration

## Effort Estimate
3 days
