# Implement role-based routing and access control

## Context & Motivation
The marketplace app needs to enforce role-based access control where users can only access their designated sections (/talent, /client, /admin). This ticket implements the routing logic and middleware that will redirect users to appropriate dashboards based on their role and prevent unauthorized access to other sections. This is essential for maintaining proper user segmentation and security.

Reference: `spec.md` - Section 3 In Scope (Role-based route protection)

## Detailed Description & Requirements

#### Functional Requirements:
- Implement role-based route protection for `/talent`, `/client`, `/admin`
- Create role-based redirect logic for authenticated users
- Implement middleware for route access control
- Create "Hello World" dashboard pages for each role
- Handle unauthenticated user redirects to `/login`
- Implement role validation and assignment logic

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Ensure route protection is enforced at middleware level
- Maintain fast routing performance
- Implement proper error handling for unauthorized access
- Follow Next.js App Router patterns
- Ensure type safety for role management

#### Validation & Error Handling:
- Handle cases where user role is not assigned
- Implement proper error pages for unauthorized access
- Handle edge cases in role assignment
- Ensure graceful fallbacks for missing user data

## Success Criteria
- Role-based route protection is implemented and working
- Users are redirected to appropriate dashboards based on role
- Unauthorized access attempts are blocked
- "Hello World" dashboard pages are created for each role
- Middleware properly validates user roles
- Role assignment logic works correctly
- Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly

## Test Plan
- `test_role_based_routing`: Verify users can only access their role-specific routes ‚Üí Talent users can access /talent, not /client or /admin
- `test_unauthorized_access`: Verify unauthorized access is blocked ‚Üí Users get error page when accessing wrong role routes
- `test_redirect_logic`: Verify users are redirected to correct dashboards ‚Üí Authenticated users go to role-appropriate dashboard
- `test_unauthenticated_redirect`: Verify unauthenticated users go to login ‚Üí Unauthenticated users redirected to /login
- `test_role_validation`: Verify role validation works correctly ‚Üí Invalid roles are handled gracefully
- `test_middleware_protection`: Verify middleware enforces route protection ‚Üí Route protection works at middleware level
- `test_dashboard_pages`: Verify dashboard pages render correctly ‚Üí Hello World pages display for each role

## Dependencies
- Depends on: `ticket-001` (Clerk integration)
- Depends on: `ticket-002` (Supabase users table)
- Requires: Next.js App Router setup
- Requires: TypeScript configuration

## Suggested Implementation Plan
1. Create role-based middleware for route protection
2. Implement role validation and assignment logic
3. Create dashboard pages for each role (/talent, /client, /admin)
4. Implement redirect logic for authenticated users
5. Add error handling for unauthorized access
6. Create custom hooks for role management
7. Test all routing scenarios and edge cases

## Effort Estimate
- Estimated effort: **3 hours**
- Assumes Clerk and Supabase integration is complete
- Includes testing and validation time
- Includes error handling and edge case management

## Priority & Impact
- Priority: **High**
- Rationale: Core security feature, required for proper user segmentation
