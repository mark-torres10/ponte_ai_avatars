7:54am: Have meeting with the team. Some things I want to bring up include:
- First video I generated, and the tools I used and the research I did to see what other people are doing out there with their workflows.
- Creating the first "playbook"
- Best thing I can do is be a "workflow orchestrator" and figure out the skeleton of the playbook and ways to automate it, and then leave the details (e.g., what makes a TikTok a "good" TikTok?) to someone else.
- Ask them straight up if they're interested in continuing past the current 8 week engagement.

Have an interactive digital replica embedded in some sort of website or business so that instead of you statically interacting with a website, you can interact with an individual.

Step 1: Cameo-esque use case
Step 2: More complex ads
Step 3: Fully interactive digital replica
- e.g., have a chatbot but then instead of a person talking to a chatbot, they talk to the virtual avatar version.

- e.g., a talking head that chats to you in real time.

Something like Delphi (I sent them this earlier).
- https://www.heygen.com/interactive-avatar

I can take one of their use cases and ship a demo (they want to use the fishing rod example).
- Probably need to create a demo
- Then in reality this will likely be embedded as a JS plugin to a website.

They want an "interactive" shopping experience, an interactive avatar going with you to scroll the Internet.

Trying to help websites be less static and more human-like.

e.g., an avatar that can be pinned to a browser and it can accompany people in real time as they're scrolling through and giving comments (e.g., an ESPN commentator can have a talking head and then as you're scrolling ESPN, they'll pop up and give commentary on that game).

- V1 MVP: creating talking head.
- V2 MVP: same talking head, on ESPN.

8:42am: Oh lol, they want a talking head then. I'll ship an MVP of that. I'll see how much I can get done today.
