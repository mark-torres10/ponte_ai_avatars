- Set up development environment

#### Issues & Blockers
- None identified at this stage

#### Notes
- Project represents a significant pivot from original backend approach
- Focus is on rapid prototyping and concept validation
- Stakeholder demo quality is priority over production architecture
- Modern tooling should enable fast development and professional results

## Technical Decisions Log

### Architecture Decisions
- **Client-Side Only**: No backend required for demo
- **Modern Tooling**: React 18 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Tailwind + Framer Motion
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, performant state
- **API Integration**: Direct client-side calls to OpenAI, Wikipedia, ElevenLabs

### Component Decisions
- **shadcn/ui**: Professional components for dialogue, buttons, cards
- **Custom Components**: Specialized avatar and dialogue components
- **Animation System**: Framer Motion for smooth, professional interactions
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, professional UI development

### Performance Decisions
- **Page Load Impact**: Target <100ms
- **Animation Performance**: Target 60fps
- **Bundle Size**: Optimize for extension loading
- **Caching**: Local state management and API response caching

---

## Risk Assessment Log

### Technical Risks
- **API CORS Issues**: Medium risk - need to research API documentation
- **Rate Limiting**: Medium risk - implement built-in rate limiting
- **Performance**: Low risk - modern tooling should handle this well
- **Browser Compatibility**: Low risk - Chrome extension focus

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Medium risk - focus on core demo features
- **Integration Issues**: Medium risk - build incrementally, test continuously
- **Polish Time**: Low risk - leverage modern components for quality

### Quality Risks
- **UI Polish**: Low risk - shadcn/ui provides professional look
- **Animation Quality**: Low risk - Framer Motion handles smooth animations
- **Error Handling**: Medium risk - implement basic error states
