9:18am: I think I'll see what free videos I can get out of Pexel and then generate the rest with Veo3. I'll stitch them together with post-production.

I'm wondering if I can use stock footage and then overlay that with questions that they're asking each time?

I think I'll default to making each one the same length for now, and then I'll change it later.

9:33am: OK, for shot 3 I might have to do some stuff here.

For Shot 6, can overlay the Raptors game and ask the AI details about it.

For shots 6-10, I can make these longer and focus on the AI overlays for them.
Shot 11 will be more stock footage.

I need to figure out deliverables. I think what I can do is:

- First pass of trailer.
- My notes.
- First pass of app (I can send them the Github link).

10:18am: OK, submitted Lemon report for the week. Next things to do are:
- Finish the last few shots
- Add AI overlay
- Compile deliverables.
