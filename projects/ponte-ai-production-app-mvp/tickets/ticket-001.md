# Ticket PON-12: Set up Next.js project foundation and brand styling system

**Linear Link:** https://linear.app/metresearch/issue/PON-12/set-up-nextjs-project-foundation-and-brand-styling-system

## Context & Motivation
This establishes the core Next.js application with proper project structure, Tailwind CSS configuration, and brand styling system extracted from the Ponte AI website. This is the foundation that all other pages will build upon.

## Functional Requirements
- Create Next.js 14+ app with App Router
- Configure Tailwind CSS with custom brand theme
- Extract brand colors and styling from Ponte AI website using Playwright MCP
- Set up ShadCN UI components
- Configure TypeScript and ESLint
- Set up project structure supporting future backend integration

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Build passes without errors
- Responsive design foundation
- Code structure supports future backend integration

## Success Criteria
- Next.js app created and building successfully
- Brand styling system matching Ponte AI website
- ShadCN components configured and working
- Project structure ready for additional pages
- **Local build passes with `npm run build`**
- **Playwright MCP validates brand styling extraction matches Ponte AI website**
- **Playwright MCP confirms responsive design foundation works**

## Test Plan
- `test_build_success`: `npm run build` completes without errors
- `test_brand_extraction`: Brand colors match Ponte AI website (validated by Playwright MCP)
- `test_responsive_foundation`: Base responsive design works (validated by Playwright MCP)

## Dependencies
- Requires: Vercel deployment setup, Playwright MCP access

## Suggested Implementation Plan
- Use `create-next-app` with TypeScript and Tailwind
- Extract brand assets from https://www.ponteai.com/ using Playwright
- Configure Tailwind theme with extracted colors
- Set up ShadCN UI components
- Create base layout and styling system
- **Verify with `npm run build`**
- **Use Playwright MCP to validate brand consistency and responsive design**

## Effort Estimate
**2 hours**

## Priority & Impact
- Priority: **High**
- Rationale: Foundation required for all other work

- [ ] Next.js app created and building
- [ ] Brand styling system extracted and configured
- [ ] ShadCN components working
- [ ] Project structure established
- [ ] Base responsive design implemented
- [ ] **Local build passes with `npm run build`**
