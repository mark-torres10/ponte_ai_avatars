# PRD: Ponte.ai MVP - Authentication and Homepage (v1)

**Author:** Gemini (Staff Engineer)
**Status:** Proposed
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-07-28

---

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for the first version (v1) of the Ponte.ai web application. The primary objective is to establish a secure, scalable, and operational foundation for user authentication and access. This initial build will focus on creating a minimal-yet-robust application hosted on Vercel, integrating with Supabase for user management. The core deliverables are a user sign-up/login flow and a protected homepage.

As this is the genesis of our production application, we are prioritizing architectural soundness, security, and modularity to ensure future features can be integrated seamlessly. While speed is a key driver, the initial framework must be built to last.

## 2. Goals

*   **Establish a Secure User Authentication System:** Implement a complete user lifecycle flow (Sign Up, Login, Logout) using Supabase.
*   **Create a Protected Content Area:** Ensure that core application content is only accessible to authenticated users.
*   **Deploy a Production-Ready Foundation:** Deploy the application to Vercel, establishing our continuous deployment pipeline and environment management.
*   **Develop a Modular Frontend Architecture:** Build the initial components in a way that they are reusable and easily extensible.

## 3. Non-Goals

*   **Social Logins (OAuth):** Support for Google, GitHub, or other third-party logins is out of scope for v1.
*   **Password Reset Flow:** A "Forgot Password" feature will not be implemented in this version.
*   **Advanced User Profile Management:** Users will not have the ability to view or edit profile information (e.g., name, avatar).
*   **Complex UI/UX:** The user interface will be clean, functional, and minimal. No advanced styling, animations, or complex design systems will be implemented.
*   **Backend API:** All backend functionality will be handled by Supabase (Backend-as-a-Service). No custom server-side API will be built.

## 4. User Stories

*   **As a New User,** I want to be able to create a new account using my email and a password so that I can access the application.
*   **As a Returning User,** I want to be able to log in with my credentials to access my account securely.
*   **As a Logged-In User,** I want to see a confirmation that I am authenticated and be able to log out of the application.
*   **As an Unauthenticated User,** I want to be prevented from accessing protected content and be redirected to the login page if I try.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### FR1: Login/Signup Page (`/login`)
- This will be the default public-facing route for unauthenticated users.
- The page must contain a single form with fields for **Email** and **Password**.
- The form will include two primary actions (buttons): **"Sign Up"** and **"Login"**.
- **Sign Up:**
    - On click, it will attempt to create a new user in the Supabase `auth.users` table with the provided credentials.
    - It must provide clear feedback for success (e.g., redirect to a "Check your email" page or directly to `/home` if email verification is disabled) and failure (e.g., "User already exists," "Password is too weak").
- **Login:**
    - On click, it will attempt to authenticate the user against the Supabase `auth.users` table.
    - Upon successful authentication, the user's session will be established, and they will be redirected to the `/home` route.
    - It must provide clear feedback for failure (e.g., "Invalid credentials").

### FR2: Home Page (`/home`)
- This route must be **protected**. It should not be accessible to anyone without a valid, active session.
- If an unauthenticated user attempts to access `/home`, they must be immediately redirected to `/login`.
- When a logged-in user accesses this page, it will display the static text: `"Hello World, you've logged in"`.
- The page must include a **"Logout"** button that, when clicked, terminates the user's session and redirects them to the `/login` page.

## 6. Technical Specification

### Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (React) - App Router
- **Authentication & DB:** Supabase
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (for rapid, utility-first styling)

### Architecture
- **Component-Based Structure:** The UI will be broken down into modular components (e.g., `AuthForm`, `Button`, `Input`).
- **Environment Variables:** All sensitive keys (Supabase URL, Supabase Anon Key) will be managed via Vercel environment variables and accessed through `process.env`. They will **not** be hardcoded.
- **Authentication Logic:**
    - We will use the `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` library to manage client-side and server-side authentication state.
    - A central `SupabaseProvider` will wrap the application to make the Supabase client available throughout the component tree.
- **Protected Routes:**
    - Route protection will be implemented using Next.js Middleware. The middleware will check for a valid user session on incoming requests to `/home` and handle redirects accordingly. This is more secure and efficient than client-side checks alone.

### Security Considerations
- **Secret Management:** All Supabase keys (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) will be stored securely in Vercel.
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Although we are not creating user data tables in v1, RLS will be enabled by default in Supabase to enforce data access rules from the start.
- **Input Validation:** Basic client-side validation will be in place for the email and password fields. Supabase provides server-side validation for authentication attempts.

## 7. Milestones

1.  **Phase 1: Project Setup & Integration**
    - Initialize Next.js project.
    - Set up Supabase project.
    - Integrate Supabase client into the Next.js application.
    - Configure Vercel deployment with environment variables.
2.  **Phase 2: Authentication UI**
    - Build the reusable `Input` and `Button` components.
    - Build the `AuthForm` component for the `/login` page.
3.  **Phase 3: Authentication Logic**
    - Implement the "Sign Up" and "Login" functions using the Supabase client SDK.
    - Implement the "Logout" functionality.
4.  **Phase 4: Protected Route & Homepage**
    - Create the `/home` page.
    - Implement the Next.js middleware to protect the `/home` route.
5.  **Phase 5: Deployment & Testing**
    - Deploy the complete application to Vercel.
    - Conduct end-to-end testing of the sign-up, login, and logout flows.

## 8. Success Metrics

- A new user can successfully create an account and log in.
- A returning user can successfully log in.
- An authenticated user can view the `/home` page and successfully log out.
- An unauthenticated user is unable to access `/home` and is redirected to `/login`.
- The application is successfully deployed and accessible via a Vercel URL.
