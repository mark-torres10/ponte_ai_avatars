8:14pm: I'll continue work on the browser extension. I'll see how to best do this.

Here are the notes for client requests:

## Different Features

### 1. Debate Mode
- **Ask a question** (e.g., “Is Giannis still the most dominant player?”) and Parker argues passionately.
- **Toggle difficulty:** Parker can “go easy” or “go savage” with the rebuttals.
- **Optional:** Bring in an AI Rival so Parker can spar while you moderate.

### 2. Hot Take Mode
- Parker delivers an **outrageous opinion of the day** (e.g., “I don’t wanna hear another WORD about the Clippers (or any sports team) until they actually win something!”).
- Could **auto-trigger** when you open ESPN for the first time that day.

### 3. Predictive Mode
- **Ask about upcoming games** and Parker gives bold predictions in his trademark dramatic style.
- **Confidence Meter:** Parker rates how sure he is (with classic hedging and flair).

## NBA Tab Feature (Podcast-Style Recap)

- When you click on the NBA tab, Parker launches into a **1–2 minute recap** of last night’s games.
- **Format:** Dramatic intro + quick game summaries + 1–2 strong takes.

**Example:**
> “Ladies and gentlemen, here’s what went down last night. Luka Doncic dropped 42 and made the Suns look like they should’ve stayed home. And don’t get me STARTED on the Knicks…”

- **Bonus:** Include stat callouts + emotional reactions (surprise, disappointment, hype).
- **Options:**
  - Daily Recap (all major games)
  - Your Teams Only (personalized to favorites you select)

## Future Expansions

- **Fan Take Reactions:** Paste a Reddit/ESPN comment, and Parker responds (e.g., “This is ridiculous, ABSURD!”).
- **Game Companion Mode:** During live games, Parker pops in with quarter/halftime takes.

8:26pm: Going back and forth with Cursor now about how to do this.

8:29pm: I'll start with creating this in Figma so that I can verify what it looks like.

8:55pm: Figma setup is looking good. Now I'll need to import this setup and update the UI accordingly.

9:11pm: Collecting screenshots now of the setup. I'll create a new project that's purely just UI and cosmetic changes.

I'll implement these specific features, sure, but just note that we shouldn't overfit to this specific use case too hard.

I think a viable approach is:
- I create a UI demo, with hardcoded stuff, and then we plan out a very specific sort of demo to record.
- Ideally they have an actual marketer who can make product launch videos, and then they can advise on what shots are needed.
- Can start with a simple Loom of the features TBH, and get those to work.

9:40pm: I'll set up this UI as a first pass, that'll be my work for the week. Luckily since it's pure UI, this should be quick AND I can set the background agents loose on it (and it should be easily parallelizable).

I can then review this with the client and also more deeply plan out what it should look like.
