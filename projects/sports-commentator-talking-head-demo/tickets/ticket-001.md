# Ticket 001: Project Setup and Basic Backend Infrastructure

**Title**: Set up project structure and basic Express.js backend service
**Type**: Task
**Priority**: High
**Estimate**: 3 days
**Labels**: setup, backend, infrastructure

## Description
Set up the foundational project structure for the Sports Commentator talking head demo, including the Express.js backend service, project configuration, and basic development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New Express.js backend service created with TypeScript
- [ ] Project structure follows established patterns
- [ ] Basic Express server runs and responds to health checks
- [ ] Environment configuration for API keys and settings
- [ ] Basic logging and error handling middleware
- [ ] Project builds successfully with `npm run build`
- [ ] Basic API endpoint structure established

## Technical Requirements
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Environment variable management
- Basic middleware setup (CORS, body parsing, logging)
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Error handling middleware
- Project documentation (README.md)

## Dependencies
- None (foundational ticket)

## Definition of Done
- Backend service runs locally on port 3001
- Health check endpoint responds successfully
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Basic project structure documented
- Ready for API integration work

## Implementation Notes
- Follow existing backend patterns from the main project
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error handling from the start
- Set up environment configuration for API keys
- Create basic project documentation

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] Environment variables load correctly
- [ ] Error handling middleware works
- [ ] Project builds successfully
