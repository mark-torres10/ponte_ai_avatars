# Linear Project: Ponte AI Marketplace Authentication System

## Problem Statement
Ponte AI's marketplace app currently lacks any authentication mechanism, making it impossible to differentiate between user types (Talent, Client, Admin) and provide appropriate access to different features. This creates a barrier to platform growth as users cannot be properly onboarded, managed, or given role-specific access. The absence of authentication also prevents the implementation of core marketplace functionality like role-based dashboards and user management.

## Objective & Success Criteria
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in with email, Google, and Microsoft authentication
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Users are properly assigned roles (Talent/Client) and can only access their designated sections
- **Onboarding Integration**: Existing talent onboarding wizard and client forms are integrated with authentication
- **Data Synchronization**: User data is properly synchronized between Clerk and Supabase
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive Jest testing with 90%+ coverage for authentication flows

## Scope & Deliverables

**In Scope:**
- Clerk authentication integration with email, Google, and Microsoft providers
- Supabase users table creation and management
- Role-based route protection (/talent, /client, /admin)
- Integration of existing talent onboarding wizard from talent-onboarding-flow project
- Integration of existing client onboarding form components
- Authentication state management and synchronization
- Comprehensive error handling for auth failures
- Jest testing framework with Clerk webhook testing
- Component composition patterns and reusability guidelines
- State management strategy implementation

**Out of Scope:**
- Admin role implementation (future phase)
- Storage of detailed onboarding form data (future enhancement)
- Advanced user profile management
- Password reset flows (handled by Clerk)
- Email verification flows (handled by Clerk)
- Performance optimization beyond MVP requirements
- Advanced security features beyond basic role protection

- Integration of existing client onboarding forms
- Component composition patterns implementation
- State management strategy implementation

**Week 4: Testing & Polish**
- Comprehensive Jest testing implementation
- Clerk webhook testing
- Role-based routing tests
- Component testing and validation
- Final integration testing and deployment preparation

## Risks & Mitigations

**Technical Risks:**
- **Clerk-Supabase Integration Complexity**: Mitigation - Use Clerk's hosted components and follow official integration patterns
- **Role Synchronization Issues**: Mitigation - Implement comprehensive testing and error handling
- **Existing Component Integration**: Mitigation - Leverage existing talent onboarding flow and extend gradually

**Product Risks:**
- **User Experience Disruption**: Mitigation - Maintain existing UI patterns and design system
- **Testing Coverage Gaps**: Mitigation - Implement comprehensive Jest testing strategy from the start

## Success Metrics
- **Authentication Success Rate**: >95% of users can successfully sign up and log in
- **Role Assignment Accuracy**: 100% of users are assigned correct roles
- **Route Protection**: 100% of unauthorized access attempts are blocked
- **Testing Coverage**: >90% code coverage for authentication components
- **Integration Success**: Existing onboarding components work seamlessly with authentication
- **Error Handling**: All authentication failures are properly handled and logged
