# AI Avatar Browser Extension v2 - Project Specification

## 1. Problem Definition and Stakeholder Identification

### Problem Statement
Sports fans currently consume sports content passively on ESPN NBA pages, missing contextual information that could enhance their understanding and engagement. When viewing NBA game scores, users lack immediate access to AI-powered commentary, team background information, and audio-enhanced content delivery. The current extension (PON-76) only provides basic avatar detection without intelligent interaction or content delivery.

### Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: Sports fans who regularly visit ESPN for NBA content
- **Secondary Users**: Casual sports viewers looking for quick context and engagement
- **Business Stakeholders**: PonteAI team evaluating new product direction and concept validation
- **Technical Stakeholders**: Development team building the extension and validating technical approach
- **Demo Audience**: Stakeholders who need to see working functionality quickly

### Current Pain Points
- Users must manually search for additional context about teams/players
- No proactive AI-powered information delivery during content consumption
- Limited engagement beyond static score displays
- Missed opportunities for deeper sports knowledge and entertainment
- Existing extension (PON-76) lacks intelligent functionality

### Solution Vision
A polished, AI-powered browser extension that automatically detects NBA games on ESPN pages and provides proactive, engaging commentary with audio synthesis. The extension will offer interactive dialogue options, Exa API-powered intelligent information retrieval, and professional-quality UI/UX that demonstrates the full potential of proactive AI assistants.

## 5. Technical Feasibility and Estimation

### Technical Architecture
```
Extension (Chrome)
├── Content Script (enhanced ESPN detection, avatar display, dialogue system)
├── Background Script (API coordination, state management)
├── UI Components (shadcn/ui + custom components)
├── State Management (Zustand store)
└── Services (OpenAI, Exa API, ElevenLabs direct integration)

No Backend Required
├── Direct API calls from extension
├── Client-side rate limiting and error handling
├── Local state management and caching
└── Secure API key storage in extension
```

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1 (Day 1)**: Foundation setup, enhanced ESPN analysis, AI integration, dialogue system
2. **Phase 2 (Day 2)**: Audio integration, Exa API integration, UI polish, testing and demo prep

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Enhanced ESPN detection, basic extension structure, UI component integration

### Enhanced Content Detection Logic
```typescript
interface EnhancedESPNPageInfo {
  isBoxscore: boolean;
  gameId?: string;
  teamNames: string[];
  gameContext: {
    scores?: { home: number; away: number };
    time?: string;
    venue?: string;
    status?: string;
  };
  url: string;
}

const analyzeESPNPageEnhanced = (): EnhancedESPNPageInfo => {
  // Multiple DOM parsing strategies
  // Pattern matching for various ESPN layouts
  // Fallback detection methods
  // Comprehensive game context extraction
};
```

### AI Integration Pattern
```typescript
interface AIResponse {
  gameRecognition: string;
  tellMeMore: string;
  goodToKnow: string;
  context: GameContext;
}

const generateAIResponse = async (gameInfo: EnhancedESPNPageInfo): Promise<AIResponse> => {
  // OpenAI API integration with context-aware prompts
  // Structured response generation
  // Error handling and fallbacks
};
```

### State Management with Zustand
```typescript
interface GameStore {
  currentGame: EnhancedESPNPageInfo | null;
  avatarState: 'idle' | 'speaking' | 'listening';
  dialogueOpen: boolean;
  currentResponse: AIResponse | null;
  audioPlaying: boolean;
  userChoice: 'tellMeMore' | 'goodToKnow' | null;
  
  // Actions
  setGame: (game: EnhancedESPNPageInfo) => void;
  setAvatarState: (state: AvatarState) => void;
  openDialogue: () => void;
  closeDialogue: () => void;
  setResponse: (response: AIResponse) => void;
  setUserChoice: (choice: UserChoice) => void;
  toggleAudio: () => void;
}
```

### UI Component Architecture
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Professional components for dialogue, buttons, cards
- **Custom Components**: Specialized avatar and dialogue components
- **Animation System**: Framer Motion for smooth, professional interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for adaptive layouts
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance built into component design
