## Project Timeline

**Start Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Target Completion**: 2025-09-12 (3 weeks)  
**Current Status**: Planning Phase Complete

---

## 2025-08-22 - Project Initiation

### Completed
- ✅ Project specification created and reviewed
- ✅ Expert reviews completed (MVP Frontend Architect, Demo Preparation)
- ✅ Project structure and documentation created
- ✅ Task plan and todo checklist established
- ✅ Linear project created and linked to project
- ✅ All 4 phase tickets created and linked to project
- ✅ Technical design document created
- ✅ UX design document created
- ✅ Implementation plan created with detailed task breakdown

## 2025-08-22 - Documentation Update: Piecemeal Approach

### Completed
- ✅ Project specification updated to reflect 3-phase piecemeal approach
- ✅ Implementation plan restructured for incremental development
- ✅ README updated with phase-based development strategy
- ✅ All documentation aligned with new piecemeal development approach
- ✅ Phase 1: Basic Talking Head Avatar System (D-ID integration)
- ✅ Phase 2: AI Question-to-Response Integration (OpenAI enhancement)
- ✅ Phase 3: Enhanced Avatar Generation Flow (complete integration)

### Key Decisions Made
- **Component Strategy**: Transform existing TextInput component rather than create new components
- **API Approach**: Create new specialized endpoint using existing generic OpenAI endpoint
- **UI Layout**: 2x2 grid for pre-selected questions above text input
- **State Management**: Add AI response state to existing flow
- **Development Approach**: Piecemeal development with 3 phases for incremental demo value
- **Phase 1 Priority**: Start with D-ID integration for basic talking head functionality
- **Phase 2 Focus**: Add AI question-response capabilities on top of working avatars
- **Phase 3 Goal**: Complete system integration for production-ready demo

### Expert Review Insights
- **MVP Frontend Architect**: Recommended component separation strategy and comprehensive testing
- **Demo Preparation Expert**: Emphasized demo risk mitigation and response quality assurance

### Next Steps
- **Documentation Updated**: All project documents updated to reflect piecemeal approach
- **Ready for Implementation**: Begin Phase 1 implementation following updated plan
- **Next Phase**: Start with D-ID integration and basic talking head system (PON-60)
- **Linear Tickets**: All 4 phases created and linked to project

## Progress Summary

### Phase Status
- **Phase 1**: Basic Talking Head Avatar System (D-ID integration) - Not Started
- **Phase 2**: AI Question-to-Response Integration (OpenAI enhancement) - Not Started  
- **Phase 3**: Enhanced Avatar Generation Flow (complete integration) - Not Started
- **Phase 4**: Testing, Polish, and Deployment - Not Started

### Effort Tracking
- **Estimated Total**: 18-24 hours across 3 phases
- **Phase 1**: 8-10 hours (D-ID integration, avatar management, basic TTS)
- **Phase 2**: 6-8 hours (AI response generation, question interface)
- **Phase 3**: 4-6 hours (system integration, workflow completion)
- **Actual Time**: 0 hours
- **Variance**: On track

### Risk Status
- **State Management Complexity**: Medium risk, mitigation planned
- **API Reliability**: Medium risk, fallback scenarios planned
- **Component Transformation**: Medium risk, comprehensive testing planned

## Notes and Observations

### Technical Considerations
- Need to maintain existing component interfaces to avoid breaking changes
- State flow complexity requires careful testing and validation
- OpenAI prompt engineering will be critical for response quality

### Demo Considerations
- Pre-generated responses needed for fallback scenarios
- Demo timing optimization required for stakeholder engagement
- Response quality validation essential for professional presentation

### Dependencies
- All existing systems (generic OpenAI, ElevenLabs, D-ID) must continue working
- New specialized endpoint must use existing generic OpenAI endpoint
- TextInput component transformation must not affect other components
- State management changes must integrate seamlessly with existing flow

---

## Blockers and Issues

### Current Blockers
- None identified

### Potential Issues
- OpenAI API rate limits or reliability
- Component state management complexity
- Integration testing complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement fallback scenarios and error handling
- Comprehensive testing of state flow
- Incremental development with frequent validation

## Next Session Goals

1. **Begin Phase 1**: Start D-ID API integration and avatar management
2. **Set up development environment** for D-ID API integration
3. **Create basic avatar management components** with photo upload functionality
4. **Test basic talking head video generation** workflow

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can upload photos to create talking head avatars
- [ ] Basic avatar customization options are available
- [ ] Text input generates talking head videos via D-ID API
- [ ] Basic TTS integration works with ElevenLabs
- [ ] Avatar management system functions properly

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can type custom questions in the text input
- [ ] Pre-selected questions appear as clickable buttons
- [ ] Clicking pre-selected questions overwrites current text input
- [ ] AI generates persona-specific responses to questions
- [ ] Responses are displayed in read-only format

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] AI response text is used for voice generation
- [ ] AI response text is used for video generation
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work
- [ ] Complete avatar generation workflow is functional

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Generation**: AI response generation completes within 5-10 seconds
- **UI Responsiveness**: Interface remains responsive during API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures with user-friendly messages
