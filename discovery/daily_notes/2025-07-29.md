11:36am: I need to do the full rewrite of the N8n app just with the prototype that I currently have.

Steps are:
- Simplify the design to remove the chat interface.
- Run everything locally and in one app.
    - Add the two profiles and their custom voices.
    - Generate videos for each
- Start connecting everything to Supabase
    - Reads/writes go to Supabase
    - (Later) Auth via Supabase
- Start cleanup and productionization
    - Add JWT auth
    - Deploy a backend. Possibly to Supabase edge functions, since we don't need anything real-time anyways.


12:46pm: OK, chat interface is gone and the workflow simplified. Still buggy, the video doesn't generate correctly but that's OK, we'll fix that in the next ticket.

We can start using our new AI agent flows on this next ticket and workflow to really speed things up.

1:37pm: Using the new AI agent rules that I have does make it so that then I have to follow up with my workflow, but that probably is better anyways because things can stay a lot more organized.

3:18pm: Frontend is looking nice plus the AI agent rules are really helping a lot with keeping the agents locked in-step and doing what they're supposed to be doing. I'll have to do the Supabase backend stuff separately, but otherwise this is looking good.
