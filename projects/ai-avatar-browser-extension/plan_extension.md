# AI Avatar Browser Extension - Task Plan

## Project Overview
Build a Chrome browser extension that provides proactive AI commentary on ESPN NBA boxscore pages, demonstrating the potential of AI avatars as proactive assistants rather than reactive chatbots.

## Timeline
**Total Duration**: 1 week  
**Start Date**: [TBD]  
**Target Completion**: [TBD + 1 week]

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Extension Foundation and ESPN Detection (Days 1-2)
**Goal**: Basic extension structure and ESPN page detection

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create Chrome extension manifest.json
- [ ] Set up content script for ESPN.com
- [ ] Implement URL pattern detection for NBA boxscore pages
- [ ] Create basic extension popup
- [ ] Test developer mode installation
- [ ] Verify ESPN page detection accuracy

**Deliverables**:
- Working Chrome extension in developer mode
- ESPN NBA boxscore page detection
- Basic extension structure

**Effort Estimate**: 2 days

### Phase 2: Backend API Development (Days 3-4)
**Goal**: Backend API with all required integrations

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Node.js/Express backend
- [ ] Integrate OpenAI API for commentary generation
- [ ] Integrate Wikipedia API for team information
- [ ] Integrate ElevenLabs API for audio synthesis
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and error handling
- [ ] Deploy backend to Vercel/Netlify
- [ ] Test all API endpoints

**Deliverables**:
- Deployed backend API
- Working integrations with all third-party APIs
- API documentation

**Effort Estimate**: 2 days

### Phase 3: Avatar UI and Audio Integration (Days 5-6)
**Goal**: Complete user experience with avatar and audio

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create avatar React component
- [ ] Implement top-right corner positioning
- [ ] Integrate audio playback system
- [ ] Connect avatar to backend API
- [ ] Test complete user flow
- [ ] Optimize performance and user experience

**Deliverables**:
- Working avatar UI component
- Audio integration
- Complete user experience flow

**Effort Estimate**: 2 days

### Phase 4: Testing, Refinement, and Deployment (Day 7)
**Goal**: Final testing and preparation for user testing

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Comprehensive testing on target pages
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Bug fixes and refinements
- [ ] Create installation documentation
- [ ] Document known issues
- [ ] Prepare for user testing

**Deliverables**:
- Fully functional MVP extension
- Testing documentation
- Installation guide
- Performance metrics

**Effort Estimate**: 1 day

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Phase 1 + Phase 2 (Days 1-4)
- Extension foundation and backend API can be developed simultaneously
- No dependencies between these phases

### Phase 3 + Content Detection (Days 5-6)
- Avatar UI development can happen alongside content parsing logic
- Both depend on Phase 1 completion

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Integration Complexity**: Start with simple integrations, add complexity gradually
- **Extension Performance**: Focus on minimal DOM manipulation and efficient content detection
- **Audio Streaming**: Use proven ElevenLabs integration, implement fallbacks

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick strictly to MVP requirements
- **Integration Issues**: Allocate extra time for Phase 3 (UI/Audio integration)
- **Testing Delays**: Keep Phase 4 focused on testing, not new features

### Dependencies
- **OpenAI API**: Ensure access and credits before starting
- **ElevenLabs API**: Verify API access and rate limits
- **Chrome Extension Development**: Familiarize with development environment early

## Success Criteria
- Extension activates on 90%+ of ESPN NBA boxscore page visits
- Avatar provides relevant information 95%+ of the time
- Users listen to full commentary 80%+ of the time
- Page loading impact remains under 100ms
- Extension works without crashes for 99%+ of page visits

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create Chrome extension project structure
3. Set up backend API project
4. Begin parallel development of extension foundation and backend API
5. Regular progress check-ins and milestone reviews
