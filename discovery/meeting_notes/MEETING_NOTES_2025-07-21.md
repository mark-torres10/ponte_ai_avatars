# Meeting notes, 2025-07-21

- App will be embedded into Lovable website.
- Give it a prompt and it gives the output of a prompt.
- AI Avatar just reads a script.

- "Zillow listing for a house" for the AI avatar. The customer puts in a listing of what they want the AI to say, and we and the avatar control that.
- AI avatar "to sound like the person"
- Can, in lieu of TikTok, IG, etc., just have the person do a self-interview for 10 minutes.
- How to deliver this to an end client? Could be anything TBH.
- We'll set up weekly touchpoints.

NOTE: this week I can (1) code up a demo of the app via Lovable, and (2) code up the backend separately.

"Workflow in a perfect world":
- ðŸ”„ FINALIZED MVP Workflow (with 4 approvals)
âœ… Step 1: Brand Interaction 1. Brand user browses available avatars on the platform 2. Clicks into one â†’ submits a video request form â—‹ Includes prompt/script, tone, and desired use case ðŸ›‘ Step 2: Pre-Generation Approvals 3. Request enters PonteAI internal review dashboard â—‹ Team reviews the request for tone, legal, compliance â—‹ Approves or rejects with comments 4. If approved, the request is sent to the Talent Team for pre-gen approval

They'll send me example requests that most people have.

Copy length will vary, could be 10 seconds, could be 1 minute, could be 5 minutes.
- I told them that for the video, anything past 30 seconds - 1 minute is bleh with the tech.

Can give them the option to export either/or/both the voice and the video.

No need to have the safety guardrails in the same way now. Can remove that.

TODO: tweak the timeline recommendation to remove the safety week.
