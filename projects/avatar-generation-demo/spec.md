# ðŸ§¾ Spec: Avatar Generation Demo for Ponte AI MVP

## 1. Problem Statement

**Who is affected?** Potential clients, internal team for validation/testing, and future investors/stakeholders for fundraising presentations.

**What's the pain point?** The current `/generate-avatar` page is just a stub, preventing Ponte AI from demonstrating their core avatar generation technology to stakeholders. This is blocking client conversations, internal validation, and fundraising efforts.

**Why now?** This is a critical component of the product roadmap and market positioning. The demo is needed immediately to begin stakeholder conversations and gather feedback.

**Strategic link:** This represents the core value proposition of Ponte AI's avatar marketplace - the ability to generate custom AI avatars with personalized voices and video content.

## 2. Desired Outcomes & Metrics

**What should be true once this is done?**
- Complete functional demo showcasing the full avatar generation pipeline
- Professional presentation suitable for client demos and investor meetings
- Seamless integration with existing Ponte AI MVP design and branding

**Success criteria:**
- Users can complete the full flow: persona selection â†’ text input â†’ AI personalization â†’ voice generation â†’ video generation â†’ feedback
- All functionality works reliably for demo purposes
- Design maintains brand consistency with existing MVP
- Backend scales independently from frontend

**No analytics tracking required** - this is a demo-focused implementation.

## 3. In Scope / Out of Scope

**In Scope:**
- Persona selection (Terry Crews and Will Howard with all images from folders)
- Text input with AI personalization (OpenAI integration)
- Voice generation (ElevenLabs integration)
- Video generation (D-ID integration)
- Download functionality for text, audio, and video assets
- Feedback form (appears after video generation)
- Separate backend API service (Express.js/TypeScript)
- Frontend integration with existing Next.js MVP
- Error handling with service-specific failure messages
- Loading states and user feedback

**Out of Scope:**
- Supabase database integration (saved for future project)
- Analytics and tracking
- Caching mechanisms
- Rate limiting considerations
- Accessibility requirements
- User authentication/accounts
- Payment processing

## 4. Stakeholders & Dependencies

**Primary Stakeholders:**
- Potential clients (demo users)
- Internal team (validation/testing)
- Investors/stakeholders (fundraising presentations)

**Technical Dependencies:**
- OpenAI API (for text personalization)
- ElevenLabs API (for voice generation)
- D-ID API (for video generation)
- Existing Ponte AI MVP frontend
- Express.js backend service

**Cross-functional Dependencies:**
- Design system consistency with existing MVP
- Brand asset integration
- API key management

## 5. Risks / Unknowns

**Technical Risks:**
- API integration complexity and failure modes
- Video generation timeouts and user experience
- State management complexity for multi-step flow
- Error handling for external API failures

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Incremental implementation (OpenAI â†’ ElevenLabs â†’ D-ID)
- Clear loading states and progress indicators
- Service-specific error messages
- Local state management for demo purposes

**Known Unknowns:**
- ElevenLabs voice IDs (to be provided later)
- Specific API response formats and error codes
- Video generation time estimates

## 6. UX Notes & Accessibility

**User Journey:**
1. Select persona (one-time choice with reset option)
2. Input text in freeform text box
3. Optional AI personalization with toggle between versions
4. Manual voice generation with loading state
5. Manual video generation with loading state
6. Download individual assets (text, audio, video)
7. Provide feedback (form appears after video generation)

**Design Requirements:**
- Exact same styling and brand assets as existing MVP
- Seamless visual integration with existing flows
- Professional appearance suitable for client demos
- Responsive design for all devices

**UX Considerations:**
- Clear progress indication through the multi-step flow
- Easy reset functionality to prevent losing progress
- Simple, intuitive controls for all interactions
- Professional loading states and error messages

## 7. Technical Notes

**Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js with TypeScript, existing MVP structure
- **Backend:** Express.js with TypeScript, separate service
- **API:** REST API for frontend-backend communication
- **State Management:** Best practice approach for complex multi-step flow
- **Storage:** Local storage for demo purposes (no database)

**Implementation Order:**
1. OpenAI text personalization
2. ElevenLabs voice generation
3. D-ID video generation

**Extensibility Considerations:**
- Modular persona system for easy addition of new personas
- Clean API structure for future Supabase integration
- Component-based architecture for feature additions
- Scalable backend design for future enhancements

**Integration Points:**
- Frontend makes REST API calls to backend
- Backend manages all external API integrations
- Error handling at each integration point
- Download functionality for generated assets

## 8. Compliance, Cost, GTM

**Compliance:** No specific compliance requirements for demo
**Cost:** API costs covered, no additional infrastructure costs
**GTM:** Critical for client demos and fundraising presentations
**Launch:** Internal validation first, then client-facing demos
