# Implement Jest testing framework and comprehensive testing strategy

## Context & Motivation
The authentication system requires comprehensive testing to ensure reliability, security, and proper functionality. This ticket implements the Jest testing framework with React Testing Library and establishes a comprehensive testing strategy that covers authentication flows, role-based routing, Clerk webhook testing, and component testing. This ensures the authentication system is robust and maintainable.

Reference: `spec.md` - Section 7.2 Testing Strategy

## Detailed Description & Requirements

#### Functional Requirements:
- Set up Jest testing framework with React Testing Library
- Implement comprehensive test coverage for authentication components
- Create Clerk webhook testing strategy and implementation
- Implement role-based routing tests
- Create component testing for onboarding flows
- Set up test utilities and mock data

#### Non-Functional Requirements:
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage for authentication components
- Ensure tests are fast and reliable
- Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
- Follow testing best practices and patterns
- Maintain test maintainability and readability

#### Validation & Error Handling:
- Test authentication failure scenarios
- Test role assignment edge cases
- Test webhook failure handling
- Test component error boundaries

## Success Criteria
- Jest testing framework is configured and working
- Test coverage meets specified requirements (90%+ for auth components)
- Clerk webhook testing is implemented and working
- Role-based routing tests are comprehensive and passing
- Component tests cover all onboarding flows
- Test utilities and mock data are available
- All tests are fast, reliable, and maintainable

## Test Plan
- `test_jest_setup`: Verify Jest framework is configured ‚Üí Jest runs tests successfully
- `test_authentication_coverage`: Verify authentication test coverage ‚Üí 90%+ coverage for auth components
- `test_clerk_webhooks`: Verify Clerk webhook testing ‚Üí Webhook events are properly tested
- `test_role_based_routing`: Verify role-based routing tests ‚Üí All routing scenarios are tested
- `test_component_testing`: Verify component tests ‚Üí All onboarding components are tested
- `test_error_scenarios`: Verify error scenario testing ‚Üí Authentication failures are tested
- `test_performance`: Verify test performance ‚Üí Tests run quickly and reliably

- Depends on: `ticket-002` (Supabase users table)
- Depends on: `ticket-003` (role-based routing)
- Depends on: `ticket-004` (onboarding integration)
- Requires: Jest and React Testing Library packages

## Suggested Implementation Plan
1. Install and configure Jest with React Testing Library
2. Set up test utilities and mock data
3. Create Clerk webhook testing implementation
4. Implement role-based routing tests
5. Create component tests for onboarding flows
6. Implement authentication failure scenario tests
7. Set up test coverage reporting
8. Optimize test performance and reliability

## Effort Estimate
- Estimated effort: **3 hours**
- Assumes all authentication features are implemented
- Includes test setup, implementation, and optimization time
- Includes test coverage analysis and improvement

## Priority & Impact
- Priority: **High**
- Rationale: Essential for system reliability and maintainability
