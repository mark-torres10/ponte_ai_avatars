# Linear Project: Sports Commentator Talking Head Demo

## Project Overview

**Title**: Sports Commentator Talking Head Demo
**Description**: Build a polished, investor-ready demo of a real-time AI avatar that provides interactive basketball commentary using ElevenLabs streaming API, D-ID streaming API, OpenAI, and WebRTC for synchronized audio-video delivery.

## Problem Statement

ESPN and other sports networks currently provide live commentary only during scheduled broadcasts, limiting fan engagement to specific time windows. Fans desire deeper, interactive engagement with sports commentary that can answer questions, explain plays, and provide insights on-demand. This demo will showcase how AI avatars can extend broadcaster presence into interactive, always-available experiences.

## Objectives

1. **Demonstrate Real-time AI Avatar Technology**: Showcase synchronized audio-video generation with sub-500ms response time
2. **Create Engaging Sports Commentary**: Build a passionate basketball commentator personality using LLM-generated responses
3. **Integrate Multiple AI Services**: Coordinate ElevenLabs, D-ID, and OpenAI APIs through a robust backend service
4. **Deliver Investor-Ready Demo**: Create a polished, professional presentation that showcases business potential
5. **Establish Technical Foundation**: Build scalable architecture that can evolve into production systems
