# PON-50 Implementation: Role-Based Routing and Access Control

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of role-based routing and access control for the Ponte AI marketplace app. The system ensures that users can only access their designated sections (`/talent`, `/client`, `/admin`) and provides appropriate redirects based on their assigned roles.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Role-Based Dashboard Pages**
   - `/talent` - Talent dashboard with profile management and booking features
   - `/client` - Client dashboard with avatar browsing and campaign management
   - `/admin` - Admin dashboard with user management and platform analytics

2. **Role Selection System**
   - `/role-selection` - Interactive role selection page for new users
   - Role assignment during user registration
   - Role validation and error handling

3. **Role-Based Navigation**
   - Dynamic navigation based on user role
   - Role-specific menu items and links
   - Loading states and error handling

4. **Custom Hooks for Role Management**
   - `useUserRole()` - Main hook for user role data
   - `useRouteAccess()` - Hook for checking route access permissions
   - `useRoleRedirect()` - Hook for role-based redirect logic
   - `useRoleAssignment()` - Hook for role assignment functionality
   - `useRoleValidation()` - Hook for role validation utilities

5. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - 22 test cases covering all role-based routing scenarios
   - Route protection logic validation
   - Role validation and assignment testing
   - Error handling and redirect logic testing

## Key Components

### 1. Role-Based Dashboard Pages

Each dashboard provides a "Hello World" interface with role-specific features:

- **Talent Dashboard** (`/talent`): Profile management, booking tracking, earnings overview
- **Client Dashboard** (`/client`): Avatar browsing, campaign management, booking history
- **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`): User management, platform analytics, system status

### 2. Role Selection System

The role selection page (`/role-selection`) allows users to choose their role:
- Interactive cards for each role (Talent, Client, Admin)
- Role-specific feature descriptions
- Automatic role assignment and redirect to appropriate onboarding

### 3. Custom Hooks

#### `useUserRole()`
```typescript
const { userData, isLoading, error, role, isAdmin, isTalent, isClient, hasRole, refetch } = useUserRole()
```

#### `useRouteAccess()`
```typescript
const { hasAccess, isLoading, error } = useRouteAccess(['talent', 'admin'])
```

#### `useRoleRedirect()`
```typescript
const { getDashboardUrl, shouldRedirectToRoleSelection, shouldRedirectToDashboard } = useRoleRedirect()
```

### 4. Role-Based Navigation

The `RoleBasedNavigation` component provides dynamic navigation based on user role:
- Different menu items for each role
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Authentication Flow

1. **Unauthenticated User**: Redirected to `/login`
2. **New Authenticated User**: Redirected to `/role-selection`
3. **User with Role**: Redirected to appropriate dashboard (`/talent`, `/client`, or `/admin`)
4. **Role Assignment**: User selects role → role saved to database → redirect to onboarding/dashboard

## Route Protection

### Protected Routes
- `/talent` - Requires `talent` or `admin` role
- `/client` - Requires `client` or `admin` role  
- `/admin` - Requires `admin` role only

### Public Routes
- `/` - Landing page (redirects authenticated users to appropriate dashboard)
- `/login` - Authentication page
- `/sign-up` - Registration page
- `/api/*` - API routes
- `/_next/*` - Next.js static assets

### Onboarding Routes
- `/onboard-talent` - Talent onboarding flow
- `/onboard-client` - Client onboarding flow

## Database Integration

The system integrates with the existing Supabase users table:
- User roles stored in the `role` column
- Role validation using TypeScript enums
- Automatic role assignment during user creation

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling implemented:
- Network errors during role fetching
- Invalid role assignments
- Authentication failures
- Database connection issues
- Graceful fallbacks for all error scenarios

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
- **22 test cases** covering all major functionality
- **Route protection logic** validation
- **Role validation** and assignment testing
- **Error handling** and redirect logic
- **Dashboard URL generation** testing

### Test Categories
1. **Protected Routes Configuration** - Route definitions and role requirements
2. **Role Validation** - Role validation and display functions
3. **Dashboard URL Generation** - URL generation for each role
4. **Role-Based Access Control** - Access control logic testing
5. **Route Protection Logic** - Route identification and protection
6. **User Role Assignment** - Role assignment and validation
7. **Error Handling** - Error scenarios and graceful handling
8. **Redirect Logic** - Redirect scenarios and logic

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Role-based route protection** implemented for `/talent`, `/client`, `/admin`
✅ **Role-based redirect logic** for authenticated users working
✅ **Middleware for route access control** implemented
✅ **"Hello World" dashboard pages** created for each role
✅ **Unauthenticated user redirects** to `/login` working
✅ **Role validation and assignment logic** implemented
✅ **All routing scenarios tested** and working

✅ **Error handling comprehensive** and user-friendly
✅ **TypeScript types implemented** for role management

## Build and Deployment

- ✅ **Build successful** with `npm run build`
- ✅ **All TypeScript errors resolved**
- ✅ **ESLint warnings addressed** (remaining warnings are from existing components)
- ✅ **Tests passing** (22/22 tests)
- ✅ **Production-ready** implementation

## Usage Examples

### Using the Role Hooks

```typescript
// In a component
import { useUserRole, useRouteAccess } from '@/lib/useUserRole'

function MyComponent() {
  const { role, isAdmin, isLoading } = useUserRole()
  const { hasAccess } = useRouteAccess(['admin'])

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>
  
  if (isAdmin) {
    return <AdminOnlyContent />
  }
  
  return <RegularContent />
}
```

### Role-Based Navigation

```typescript
// In a layout component
import RoleBasedNavigation from '@/components/RoleBasedNavigation'

function Layout() {
  return (
    <header>
      <RoleBasedNavigation />
    </header>
  )
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Middleware**: Implement more sophisticated middleware with role-based route protection
2. **Role Permissions**: Add granular permissions system within roles
3. **Role Switching**: Allow users to switch between roles (with admin approval)
4. **Audit Logging**: Track role changes and access attempts
5. **Role-Based UI Components**: Create role-specific UI components and layouts

## Conclusion

The role-based routing and access control system is now fully implemented and ready for production use. The system provides:

- **Secure access control** based on user roles
- **Intuitive user experience** with appropriate redirects
- **Comprehensive error handling** for all scenarios
- **Extensive test coverage** ensuring reliability
- **Type-safe implementation** with TypeScript
- **Scalable architecture** for future enhancements

The implementation follows best practices for authentication, authorization, and user experience, providing a solid foundation for the Ponte AI marketplace platform.
