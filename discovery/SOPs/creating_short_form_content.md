## 1. Script Creation
**Responsible:** Creative Lead / Copywriter  

1. Draft **3–5 script variants** using ChatGPT (or similar).  
2. Structure each script into three parts:  
   - **Hook (0–3s):** Attention-grabber or curiosity gap.  
   - **Value/Story (4–25s):** Key insight, benefit, or story.  
   - **CTA (26–35s):** Engagement prompt (follow, try, check out).  
3. Store scripts in Google Drive → `/Scripts/[TalentName]/[Date]`.

## 2. Audio Generation
**Responsible:** Audio Lead  

1. Import script into **ElevenLabs**.  
2. Select correct talent voice.  
3. Adjust pacing and emphasis for clarity.  
4. Export as `.mp3` and save to Google Drive → `/Audio/[TalentName]/[Date]`.

**Responsible:** Video Lead  

- **Option A: Talking Head Video (HeyGen)**  
  1. Upload talent image + ElevenLabs audio.  
  2. Generate 9:16 talking head video.  

- **Option B: Cinematic Scene (Veo3 or Higgsfield)**

## 4. Postprocessing & Editing
**Responsible:** Editor  

1. Open **CapCut** project with 9:16 ratio.  
2. Import chosen video + audio.  
3. Add layers:  
   - **Layer 1 (Video):** Talking head or cinematic base.  
   - **Layer 2 (Captions):** Auto-generate captions → style with bold colors/emojis.  
   - **Layer 3 (B-Roll):** Insert product or stock clips (Pexels, Storyblocks, Runway).  
   - **Layer 4 (Audio):** Sync ElevenLabs voice + add trending music (low volume).  
   - **Layer 5 (Overlays):** Logo watermark, branded outro card.  
4. Edit pacing: jump cuts every 2–4 seconds.  
5. Ensure captions animate in TikTok-native style.
