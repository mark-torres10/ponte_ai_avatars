# AI Question-to-Response Avatar Generation Feature

## Project Overview

Transform the existing avatar generation flow from script-based input to interactive question-based AI responses using a piecemeal development approach. The project is divided into three phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Basic Talking Head Avatar System - D-ID integration for avatar generation
2. **Phase 2**: AI Question-to-Response Integration - OpenAI-powered intelligent responses  
3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced Avatar Generation Flow - Complete system integration

Each phase builds upon the previous to deliver incremental, demo-able functionality while maintaining the existing system's integrity.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Talking Head Avatar System
- **D-ID Integration**: API integration for talking head video generation
- **Avatar Management**: Photo upload and basic avatar customization
- **Text-to-Speech**: Integration with existing ElevenLabs API
- **Basic Video Generation**: Simple text input to talking head video workflow

### Phase 2: AI Question-to-Response Integration
- **Question Input Interface**: Transform TextInput component from script input to question input
- **Pre-selected Questions**: 4 professional, entrepreneur-focused questions for quick access
- **AI Response Generation**: Use existing OpenAI endpoint to generate persona-specific responses
- **Response Display**: Show AI responses in read-only format below the input

### Phase 3: Enhanced Avatar Generation Flow
- **Complete Integration**: AI responses automatically become the text for voice and video generation
- **Professional Interface**: Enhanced user experience and workflow
- **Advanced Features**: Avatar customization and personality options
- **Production Ready**: Complete system for stakeholder demos

## Pre-selected Questions

1. "What's your biggest piece of advice for someone starting their first business?"
2. "How do you handle setbacks and failures in entrepreneurship?"
3. "What's the most important lesson you've learned about building a team?"
4. "How do you stay motivated during challenging times in business?"

## Technical Approach

- **Phase 1**: D-ID API integration, avatar management, basic TTS
- **Phase 2**: Enhanced OpenAI endpoint, question interface, AI response display
- **Phase 3**: Complete system integration, enhanced user experience, production features

## Implementation Effort

- **Phase 1**: 8-10 hours (D-ID integration, avatar management, basic TTS)
- **Phase 2**: 6-8 hours (AI response generation, question interface)
- **Phase 3**: 4-6 hours (system integration, workflow completion)
- **Total Estimate**: 18-24 hours across 3 phases

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
