# Linear Project: AI Avatar Browser Extension V2

## Project Title
AI Avatar Browser Extension V2 - Interactive Sports Commentary

## Problem Statement
Sports fans need more engaging and interactive UI experiences when consuming sports content. The current AI Avatar Browser Extension provides basic contextual information, but users need a comprehensive UI framework that allows them to interact with Parker, the AI sports commentator, in multiple ways - from debates and predictions to real-time game commentary. This project focuses on building the UI foundation with detailed visual states and mock content that will support future API integrations.

## Objectives
1. **Enhanced UI Interactivity**: Implement 6 distinct UI modes with detailed visual states
2. **Visual Consistency**: Maintain consistent design language across all features using shadcn-ui
3. **Interactive Elements**: Create engaging UI components with proper state management
4. **User Experience**: Build intuitive navigation and smooth transitions between modes
5. **Technical Performance**: Ensure smooth UI operation without browser impact

## Success Criteria
- **UI Completeness**: All 6 modes implemented with exact visual match to provided screenshots
- **Interactive Elements**: All buttons, toggles, and input fields function correctly with proper visual states
- **Visual Consistency**: Clean, modern design using shadcn-ui components throughout
- **Mock Content**: All modes display appropriate mock content demonstrating intended functionality
- **Performance**: Extension load time <200ms, smooth animations and transitions
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

## Scope

### In Scope
- **Core UI Framework**: Click avatar to reveal 6 feature icons in 2x3 grid with hover effects
- **Debate Mode**: Interactive Q&A interface with difficulty toggle (go easy vs go savage) and mock responses
- **Hot Take Mode**: UI for displaying daily outrageous opinions with "SPICY" labels and mock content
- **Predictive Mode**: Interface with confidence meter and mock prediction responses
- **NBA Recap Mode**: Tabbed interface for daily/team-specific recaps with mock content
- **Fan Take Reactions**: "Coming Soon" interface with mock instructional content
- **Game Companion Mode**: "Coming Soon" interface with mock live commentary description
- **Chrome Extension**: Manifest V3 with content script + popup UI (no background script needed)
- **Mock Data**: Static JSON files for all UI states and content display

### Out of Scope
- API integrations (Exa MCP, Wikipedia, OpenAI, ElevenLabs)
- Backend API development
- Real-time data fetching
- Audio generation and playback
- Mobile browser support
- User authentication and personalization
- Social sharing features
- Multiple avatar personalities
- Advanced analytics and user tracking
- Monetization features
- Other sports beyond NBA
- Offline functionality

## Timeline
- **Duration**: 5 weeks
- **Start Date**: [To be determined]
- **End Date**: [To be determined]

## Team Composition
- **Frontend Developer**: UI/UX implementation, React components, mock data creation
- **Extension Developer**: Chrome extension architecture, popup UI
- **QA Engineer**: Testing and validation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **UI Complexity**: 6 different modes with detailed visual states might impact performance
  - *Mitigation*: Optimize component rendering and implement efficient state management
- **Chrome Extension Limitations**: Popup size and interaction constraints
  - *Mitigation*: Follow Chrome extension best practices and test across different screen sizes
- **Mock Data Management**: Large amounts of static content might impact load times
  - *Mitigation*: Implement lazy loading and optimize mock data structure

### Product Risks
- **Feature Complexity**: 6 different modes might overwhelm users
  - *Mitigation*: Start with core modes, add complexity gradually
- **Mock Content Quality**: Static mock content might not demonstrate intended functionality effectively
  - *Mitigation*: Create comprehensive mock data that showcases each mode's potential

## Dependencies
- Chrome extension development environment
- React and TypeScript setup
- shadcn-ui component library
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- Mock data creation and management

## Technical Architecture
```
Extension (Chrome)
├── Content Script (ESPN detection, UI injection)
├── Popup UI (main feature interface)
├── Components (mode-specific interfaces)
└── Mock Data (static JSON files for all content)

No Backend Required
├── Static mock data for all UI states
├── Local state management for user interactions
└── Chrome extension storage for user preferences
```

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Basic UI framework and feature navigation
2. **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Debate Mode and Hot Take Mode UI implementation
3. **Phase 3 (Week 3)**: Predictive Mode and NBA Recap Mode UI implementation
4. **Phase 4 (Week 4)**: Fan Take Reactions and Game Companion Mode UI implementation
5. **Phase 5 (Week 5)**: UI testing, optimization, and deployment

## Success Metrics
- **Primary**: UI completeness, visual consistency, user engagement, performance
- **Secondary**: Mock content quality, feature discovery, user retention, accessibility compliance

## Project Status
- **Current Phase**: Planning and Setup
- **Next Steps**: Create detailed tickets and begin implementation
- **Blockers**: None identified

## Notes
- Building on existing V1 extension foundation
- Focus on UI consistency and visual design across all features
- Prioritize user experience and performance
- Use shadcn-ui for consistent component design
- Implement comprehensive mock data for all UI states
- All features are UI-only with no backend dependencies
- Implement comprehensive testing for all interactive features
