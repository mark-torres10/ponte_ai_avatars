- Search and filtering work accurately
- Bulk operations execute with confirmation
- Status workflow allows bidirectional changes
- Table is responsive and paginated
- Hidden route is not discoverable in navigation

## Test Plan
- Test dashboard loading with various data sizes
- Verify search and filtering functionality

- Verify hidden route accessibility

## Dependencies
