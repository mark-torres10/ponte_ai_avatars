- [ ] Implement read-only text area for responses
- [ ] Style response area to be visually distinct
- [ ] Add loading states for response generation
- [ ] Test response display functionality
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Dependencies**: Task 1.1

## Phase 2: Backend API Enhancement (2-3 hours)

### Task 2.1: Create new specialized endpoint for persona question responses
- [ ] Create new endpoint that uses existing generic OpenAI endpoint
- [ ] Design endpoint interface for question-to-response generation
- [ ] Implement prompt construction for persona-specific responses
- [ ] Test endpoint with question inputs
- [ ] Validate response quality and format
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Dependencies**: None

### Task 2.2: Implement question-to-response prompt engineering
- [ ] Design prompts for generating persona-specific responses
- [ ] Test prompts with different question types
- [ ] Optimize prompts for response quality and consistency
- [ ] Validate persona authenticity in responses
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Dependencies**: Task 2.1

## Phase 3: State Management and Integration (2-3 hours)

### Task 3.1: Implement new state management for AI responses
- [ ] Add AI response state to component state
- [ ] Implement state flow: question → response → voice → video
- [ ] Update parent component state management
- [ ] Test state transitions and data flow
- [ ] Validate state consistency across components
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 1.1, 2.1

### Task 3.2: Integrate AI responses with existing voice and video generation
- [ ] Ensure AI response text flows to voice generation
- [ ] Ensure AI response text flows to video generation
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow integration
- [ ] Validate no changes to ElevenLabs or D-ID integrations
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Dependencies**: Task 3.1

## Phase 4: Testing and Polish (2-3 hours)

### Task 4.1: End-to-end flow testing
- [ ] Test complete flow: persona selection → question → response → voice → video
- [ ] Test with pre-selected questions
- [ ] Test with custom questions
- [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Validate all existing functionality continues to work
- **Effort**: 1-2 hours
- **Dependencies**: All previous tasks

### Task 4.2: Error handling and edge case testing
- [ ] Test OpenAI API failure scenarios
- [ ] Test network connectivity issues
- [ ] Test malformed responses
- [ ] Test component state edge cases
- [ ] Implement graceful error handling
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Dependencies**: Task 4.1

## Additional Tasks

### Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] Update component documentation
- [ ] Add inline code comments
- [ ] Update README with new feature description
- [ ] Clean up any temporary code or debugging statements

### Demo Preparation
- [ ] Test feature in demo environment
- [ ] Prepare demo script for stakeholders
- [ ] Validate demo timing and flow
- [ ] Test fallback scenarios for live demos

## Progress Tracking

- **Total Tasks**: 10 main tasks + 4 additional tasks
- **Completed**: 0/14 (0%)
- **In Progress**: 0/14 (0%)
- **Blocked**: 0/14 (0%)
- **Estimated Total Effort**: 10-15 hours
