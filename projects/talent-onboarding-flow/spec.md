# Talent Onboarding Flow - Specification

## Phase 1: Problem Definition and Stakeholder Identification

### Problem Statement
Currently, the talent onboarding process is a placeholder "Coming Soon" page that doesn't allow creators to join the platform. This creates a barrier to growth as potential talent cannot be onboarded, limiting the available avatars for clients and reducing platform revenue potential.

### Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: Content creators and individuals wanting to monetize their likeness
- **Secondary Users**: Platform administrators who need to review and approve talent
- **Business Stakeholders**: Platform owners who need talent to generate revenue
- **End Users**: Clients who will license the created avatars

### Current Pain Points
- No way for talent to join the platform
- Missing onboarding flow for avatar creation
- No standardized process for collecting talent metadata
- Lack of talent dashboard for profile management

## Phase 2: Success Metrics and Validation Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- **Completion Rate**: >80% of users who start onboarding complete the process
- **Time to Complete**: Average onboarding time <10 minutes
- **Data Quality**: >90% of profiles have complete required information
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating on onboarding experience

### Secondary Success Metrics
- **Mobile Completion Rate**: >75% completion on mobile devices
- **Draft Save Rate**: >60% of users save drafts and return
- **AI Persona Generation**: >70% of users generate AI personas
- **Profile Completion**: >85% of profiles include optional self-interview

### Validation Criteria
- All form fields validate correctly
- File uploads work across all supported formats
- Progress saving functions properly
- Mock dashboard displays accurate information
- AI persona generation produces relevant results

## Phase 3: Scope Boundaries and Technical Requirements

   - API endpoints for talent CRUD operations
   - File storage integration with Supabase Storage
   - Email notification system with multiple templates
   - Data persistence and state management
   - Admin email configuration system

### Out of Scope (Phase 2)
- Real authentication system (will be added at the end)
- Payment processing
- Real analytics and metrics (mock data initially)
- Access control (will be added at the end)

### Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript

## Phase 4: User Experience Considerations

### User Journey
1. **Landing**: User arrives at `/onboard-client` from navigation
2. **Introduction**: Clear explanation of the onboarding process and benefits
3. **Step-by-Step Progress**: Visual progress bar and clear navigation
4. **Media Upload**: Intuitive drag-and-drop with preview
5. **Personality Selection**: Guided selection with helpful descriptions
6. **Self-Interview**: Optional but encouraged with examples
7. **Review**: Summary of all information before submission
8. **Success**: Confirmation and redirect to mock dashboard
9. **Dashboard**: Overview of profile and next steps

### Key UX Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only what's needed when it's needed
- **Clear Feedback**: Immediate validation and progress indicators
- **Flexibility**: Allow users to go back and edit previous steps
- **Encouragement**: Positive messaging and clear benefits
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Error Handling
- **Validation Errors**: Clear, specific error messages
- **Upload Failures**: Retry mechanisms and helpful guidance
- **Network Issues**: Offline capability with sync when online
- **Form Abandonment**: Automatic saving and recovery

## Phase 5: Technical Feasibility and Estimation

### Technical Architecture
```
Frontend Components:
├── OnboardingWizard (main container)
├── BasicInfoStep (name, email, contact)
├── MediaUploadStep (headshots, video)
├── TonePersonalityStep (descriptors, sliders)
├── SelfInterviewStep (questions, free-form)
├── ReviewStep (summary, submit)
├── ProgressIndicator (wizard progress)
├── FileUpload (drag-drop, preview)
├── ToneSelector (categories, sliders)
├── VoiceRecorder (optional recording)
├── MockDashboard (profile overview)
├── AdminTalentReview (main admin dashboard)
├── TalentTable (table view with search/filter)
├── TalentDetailView (detailed talent profile)
├── TalentPreview (quick preview modal)
├── AnalyticsDashboard (onboarding metrics)
└── MediaManager (file management interface)
```

### Data Models
```typescript
interface TalentProfile {
  id: string;
  basicInfo: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    phone?: string;
    location?: string;
  };
  media: {
    headshots: File[];
    videoSample?: File;
  };
  personality: {
    toneCategories: string[];
    personalityTraits: {
      extroversion: number;
      formality: number;
      energy: number;
      professionalism: number;
    };
    customTone?: string;
  };
  interview: {
    predefinedAnswers: Record<string, string>;
    freeformText?: string;
    freeformAudio?: string;
  };
  status: 'draft' | 'submitted' | 'approved' | 'active' | 'rejected';
  mediaApproved: boolean;
  adminNotes?: string;
  mediaChangeRequests?: string[];
  statusChangeHistory: {
    from: string;
    to: string;
    timestamp: Date;
    adminId?: string;
    notes?: string;
  }[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  submittedAt?: Date;
  approvedAt?: Date;
}
```

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1A**: Basic wizard structure and navigation (2-3 days)
2. **Phase 1B**: Basic info and media upload steps (3-4 days)
3. **Phase 1C**: Tone/personality and interview steps (3-4 days)
4. **Phase 1D**: Review step and form submission (2-3 days)
5. **Phase 1E**: Mock dashboard and AI integration (3-4 days)
6. **Phase 1F**: Admin talent review dashboard (4-5 days)
7. **Phase 1G**: Backend integration and Supabase setup (3-4 days)
8. **Phase 1H**: Testing, refinement, and polish (2-3 days)

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Basic form components, existing design system
- **Medium Risk**: File upload handling, AI integration
- **High Risk**: Voice recording implementation, complex state management

### Mitigation Strategies
- **File Upload**: Use proven libraries and implement fallbacks
- **AI Integration**: Start with mock responses, add real API later
- **State Management**: Keep it simple initially, refactor if needed
- **Voice Recording**: Research browser compatibility thoroughly

## Success Criteria Summary
