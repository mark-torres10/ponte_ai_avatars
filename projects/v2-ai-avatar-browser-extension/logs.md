**Linear Project**: [AI Avatar Browser Extension v2 - Polished Demo MVP](https://linear.app/metresearch/project/ai-avatar-browser-extension-v2-polished-demo-mvp-ad9d9eba700d)  
**Timeline**: 1-2 days for polished demo delivery  

## Development Log

### 2025-08-27 - Project Setup & Planning
**Time**: 2 hours  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  

#### What Was Accomplished
- Created comprehensive brain dump document
- Developed detailed project specification
- Created Linear project in PonteAI team
- Established project folder structure
- Created task plan with 8 tickets
- Set up tracking files and documentation

---

### 2025-08-28 - Linear Ticket Creation & Project Setup Completion
**Time**: 1 hour  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  

#### What Was Accomplished
- Created all 8 Linear tickets (PON-81 through PON-88) in the project
- Linked all tickets to the AI Avatar Browser Extension v2 project
- Updated project documentation with Linear ticket references
- Completed Phase 3.5 (File Organization and Project Tracking Setup)
- Ready to proceed to Phase 4 (Design and Architecture Planning)

#### Key Decisions Made
- Pivot from backend-first to client-side demo approach
- Focus on polished, showcase-quality UI/UX
- Use modern tooling: shadcn/ui, Tailwind, Framer Motion, Zustand
- 1-2 day timeline for rapid demo delivery
- Client-side API integration for speed

#### Technical Considerations
- Need to research API CORS policies for client-side calls
- Ensure shadcn/ui components work in extension context
- Validate that all chosen technologies are extension-compatible
- Plan for API rate limiting and error handling

#### Next Steps
- ‚úÖ All Linear tickets created and linked to project
- Begin Phase 4: Design and architecture planning
- Prepare for implementation of Ticket 001 (Foundation Setup)
- Research API integration requirements
- Set up development environment

#### Issues & Blockers
- None identified at this stage

#### Notes
- Project represents a significant pivot from original backend approach
- Focus is on rapid prototyping and concept validation
- Stakeholder demo quality is priority over production architecture
- Modern tooling should enable fast development and professional results

## Technical Decisions Log

### Architecture Decisions
- **Client-Side Only**: No backend required for demo
- **Modern Tooling**: React 18 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui + Tailwind + Framer Motion
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, performant state
- **API Integration**: Direct client-side calls to OpenAI, Wikipedia, ElevenLabs

### Component Decisions
- **shadcn/ui**: Professional components for dialogue, buttons, cards
- **Custom Components**: Specialized avatar and dialogue components
- **Animation System**: Framer Motion for smooth, professional interactions
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, professional UI development

### Performance Decisions
- **Page Load Impact**: Target <100ms
- **Animation Performance**: Target 60fps
- **Bundle Size**: Optimize for extension loading
- **Caching**: Local state management and API response caching

---

## Risk Assessment Log

### Technical Risks
- **API CORS Issues**: Medium risk - need to research API documentation
- **Rate Limiting**: Medium risk - implement built-in rate limiting
- **Performance**: Low risk - modern tooling should handle this well
- **Browser Compatibility**: Low risk - Chrome extension focus

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Medium risk - focus on core demo features
- **Integration Issues**: Medium risk - build incrementally, test continuously
- **Polish Time**: Low risk - leverage modern components for quality

### Quality Risks
- **UI Polish**: Low risk - shadcn/ui provides professional look
- **Animation Quality**: Low risk - Framer Motion handles smooth animations
- **Error Handling**: Medium risk - implement basic error states
