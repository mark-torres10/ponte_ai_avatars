# AI Avatar Browser Extension - Project Specification

## 1. Problem Definition and Stakeholder Identification

### Problem Statement
Sports fans currently consume sports content passively, missing contextual information that could enhance their understanding and engagement. When viewing NBA game scores on ESPN, users lack immediate access to relevant background information about teams, players, and game context.

### Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: Sports fans who regularly visit ESPN for NBA content
- **Secondary Users**: Casual sports viewers looking for quick context
- **Business Stakeholders**: PonteAI team evaluating new product direction
- **Technical Stakeholders**: Development team building the extension

### Current Pain Points
- Users must manually search for additional context about teams/players
- No proactive information delivery during content consumption
- Limited engagement beyond static score displays
- Missed opportunities for deeper sports knowledge

## 2. Success Metrics and Validation Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- **Extension Activation Rate**: Avatar activates on 90%+ of ESPN NBA boxscore page visits
- **Content Accuracy**: Wikipedia information is relevant and accurate 95%+ of the time
- **User Engagement**: Users listen to full avatar commentary 80%+ of the time
- **Performance Impact**: Page loading time increases by <100ms

### Secondary Success Metrics
- **Installation Rate**: 100+ developer mode installations within first week
- **User Feedback**: Positive sentiment in initial user testing
- **Technical Reliability**: Extension works without crashes for 99%+ of page visits

### Validation Criteria
- Avatar successfully detects and activates on ESPN NBA boxscore pages
- Wikipedia API calls return relevant team information
- Audio output is clear and intelligible
- Extension doesn't interfere with ESPN page functionality
- No conflicts with existing browser extensions

## 3. Scope Boundaries and Technical Requirements

### In Scope (MVP)
- Chrome browser extension (developer mode)
- ESPN NBA boxscore page detection (URL pattern: `/nba/boxscore/_/gameId/*`)
- Static avatar visualization (generic sports commentator in circle)
- Top-right corner positioning
- Automatic activation on page load
- Wikipedia first paragraph integration
- OpenAI text generation for commentary
- ElevenLabs audio synthesis
- Simple backend API for API management
- 1-week development timeline

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- Firefox/Safari compatibility
- Mobile browser support
- User customization options
- Multiple avatar personalities
- Interactive conversations
- Social sharing features
- Monetization features
- Other sports or content sources

### Technical Requirements
- **Extension Architecture**: Content script + background script pattern
- **Content Detection**: URL pattern matching + page content analysis
- **API Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4, Wikipedia API, ElevenLabs
- **Performance**: <100ms page load impact
- **Security**: Minimal permissions, no data collection
- **Compatibility**: Chrome 90+, modern JavaScript features

## 4. User Experience Considerations

### User Flow
1. User installs extension in developer mode
2. User visits ESPN NBA boxscore page
3. Extension automatically detects page type
4. Avatar appears in top-right corner
5. Avatar begins speaking about teams and context
6. User can continue browsing while listening
7. Avatar completes commentary and remains visible

### User Interface Design
- **Avatar Appearance**: Generic sports commentator in circular frame
- **Positioning**: Top-right corner, fixed position
- **Size**: 80x80px circle, non-intrusive
- **Visual Style**: Professional, clean, sports-themed
- **Animation**: Subtle entrance animation, no distracting movements

### Accessibility Considerations
- Audio can be interrupted by user actions
- Avatar remains visible for reference
- No keyboard navigation required
- Screen reader compatible content

## 5. Technical Feasibility and Estimation

### Technical Architecture
```
Extension (Chrome)
├── Content Script (page detection, avatar display)
├── Background Script (API coordination)
└── Popup (basic settings)

Backend API
├── OpenAI integration
├── Wikipedia API integration
├── ElevenLabs integration
└── Rate limiting and caching
```

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1 (Days 1-2)**: Extension foundation and ESPN detection
2. **Phase 2 (Days 3-4)**: Backend API and AI integration
3. **Phase 3 (Days 5-6)**: Avatar UI and audio integration
4. **Phase 4 (Day 7)**: Testing, refinement, and deployment

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: URL pattern detection, basic extension structure
- **Medium Risk**: Wikipedia content relevance, audio streaming
- **High Risk**: OpenAI API integration, performance optimization

### Dependencies
- OpenAI API access and credits
- ElevenLabs API access
- Wikipedia API availability
- Chrome extension development environment
- Backend hosting (Vercel/Netlify)

## 6. Implementation Details

### Extension Structure
```
extension/
├── manifest.json
├── src/
│   ├── content-script.ts
│   ├── background-script.ts
│   ├── popup.tsx
│   └── components/
│       └── Avatar.tsx
├── public/
│   ├── avatar-icon.png
│   └── icon-128.png
└── dist/ (built files)
```

### Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/generate-commentary` - OpenAI integration
- `GET /api/wikipedia/:team` - Wikipedia content retrieval
- `POST /api/synthesize-audio` - ElevenLabs integration

### Content Detection Logic
```typescript
const isESPNBoxscore = (url: string): boolean => {
  return url.match(/espn\.com\/nba\/boxscore\/_\/(gameId\/\d+)/);
};

const extractTeamNames = (pageContent: string): string[] => {
  // Parse ESPN page content for team names
  // Look for team name patterns in headings, scores, etc.
};
```

### Avatar Integration
- Content script injects avatar component into page
- Avatar positioned absolutely in top-right corner
- Z-index ensures avatar appears above page content
- Responsive positioning for different screen sizes

## 7. Success Criteria Summary

A successful MVP will demonstrate:
1. **Proactive AI Interaction**: Avatar activates automatically without user input
2. **Contextual Relevance**: Information provided is directly related to page content
3. **Seamless Integration**: Extension works without disrupting ESPN experience
4. **Performance**: Minimal impact on page loading and user experience
5. **Reliability**: Consistent activation and content delivery
6. **User Value**: Enhanced sports content consumption experience

This specification provides a clear roadmap for building a focused, impactful MVP that demonstrates the potential of proactive AI assistants while maintaining technical feasibility within the 1-week timeline.
