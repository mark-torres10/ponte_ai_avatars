# AI Avatar Browser Extension v2 - Brain Dump

## Project Context & Background

### What We're Building
- **AI Avatar Browser Extension** that provides proactive sports commentary on ESPN NBA pages
- **Version 2**: Pivoting from backend-first approach to client-side demo for rapid prototyping
- **Goal**: Ship a polished, showcase-quality demo quickly to validate the concept

### Why This Pivot
- **Original Plan**: Backend API development (PON-77) was taking too long
- **New Approach**: Client-side integration for immediate demo capability
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days instead of 5+ days
- **Focus**: Working functionality over perfect architecture

### Current State
- âœ… **PON-76 Complete**: Extension foundation, ESPN detection, avatar placeholder
- âœ… **Working Extension**: Detects ESPN NBA boxscore pages, shows avatar
- âœ… **Basic Infrastructure**: TypeScript, React, Webpack, Chrome extension structure
- ðŸ”„ **PON-77 Pivoted**: Moving away from separate backend

## Core Requirements & Vision

### User Experience Flow
1. User visits ESPN NBA boxscore page
2. Extension automatically detects NBA game
3. AI avatar appears and recognizes the game
4. Avatar offers commentary: "Oh, I know this game, it's between {Team A} and {Team B}"
5. User gets options: "Tell me more" vs "Good to know"
6. "Tell me more" â†’ Wikipedia team info (first 2-3 sentences)
7. "Good to know" â†’ Generic response
8. All responses displayed in white dialogue popup with black text
9. Audio plays and syncs with streaming text

### Technical Requirements
- **Client-Side Only**: No backend, everything in extension
- **API Integrations**: OpenAI, Wikipedia, ElevenLabs (direct calls)
- **UI Quality**: Professional, polished, not basic HTML popup
- **Performance**: <100ms page load impact
- **Compatibility**: Chrome extension, ESPN NBA pages

### Success Criteria
- **Demo Quality**: Stakeholder-impressing UI/UX
- **Functionality**: Working ESPN detection, AI responses, audio
- **Polish**: Smooth animations, professional design
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days development

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Modern Tooling Stack
- **UI Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript (already in place)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Zustand (lightweight, perfect for extensions)
- **Animation**: Framer Motion (smooth, professional animations)
- **Icons**: Lucide React (modern, consistent icon set)

### Component Architecture
- **shadcn/ui Components**: Dialog, Button, Card, Avatar, Badge
- **Custom Components**: Avatar, DialoguePopup, StreamingText, ActionButtons
- **Layout**: FloatingContainer for positioned overlays
- **Services**: Direct API integration (no abstraction layers)

### State Management
- **Zustand Store**: Game info, avatar state, dialogue state, audio state
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Reactive Updates**: Real-time UI updates

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Focus on working functionality
- **Modern Components**: Leverage shadcn/ui for professional look
- **Incremental Build**: Build-test-fix cycle
- **Polish Focus**: UI/UX that impresses stakeholders

### Timeline Breakdown
- **Day 1**: Foundation, ESPN analysis, AI integration, dialogue system
- **Day 2**: Audio integration, Wikipedia, UI polish, testing

### Key Features Priority
1. **Enhanced ESPN Detection** (builds on existing)
2. **AI Response Generation** (core functionality)
3. **Professional Dialogue UI** (showcase quality)
4. **Audio Integration** (completes experience)
5. **Wikipedia Integration** (enriches responses)

## Questions & Considerations

### Technical Questions
- Do we have API keys for OpenAI and ElevenLabs?
- Any CORS issues with direct client-side API calls?
- Rate limiting considerations for APIs?
- Browser compatibility beyond Chrome?

### Design Questions
- Any specific shadcn/ui components to prioritize?
- Color scheme preferences for the dialogue UI?
- Animation style preferences (subtle vs. prominent)?
- Avatar personality/characteristics?

### Testing Questions
- Which ESPN NBA pages should we test against?
- Any specific edge cases to consider?
- Performance benchmarks to target?
- Accessibility requirements?

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API CORS Issues**: Research API documentation, implement alternatives
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting and fallbacks
- **Performance**: Optimize bundle size, lazy load components
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test on Chrome, Edge, Firefox

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Focus on core demo features only
- **Integration Issues**: Build incrementally, test continuously
- **Polish Time**: Prioritize functionality over perfection

### Quality Risks
- **UI Polish**: Leverage shadcn/ui for professional look
- **Animation Quality**: Use Framer Motion for smooth animations
- **Error Handling**: Basic error states with user-friendly messages

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- ESPN game detection accuracy >95%
- AI response relevance and quality
- Audio-text synchronization accuracy
- User interaction completion rate

### Quality Metrics
- UI/UX professional appearance
- Animation smoothness (60fps)
- Responsive design across screen sizes
- Accessibility compliance

### Demo Metrics
- Stakeholder impression and feedback

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Create project structure and documentation
2. Set up Linear project and tickets
3. Begin implementation with modern tooling
4. Focus on rapid, polished demo delivery

### Future Considerations
- Backend architecture for production
- Additional sports/leagues support
- User customization options
- Monetization features

## Key Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- OpenAI API allows client-side calls
- Wikipedia API allows client-side calls
- ElevenLabs can stream audio to extension
- shadcn/ui components work well in extension context

### Business Assumptions
- Stakeholders want to see working functionality quickly
- Demo quality is more important than production architecture
- 1-2 day timeline is achievable with modern tooling
- Client-side approach validates the core concept

### User Assumptions
- Users want proactive sports commentary
- ESPN NBA pages are the right starting point
- Audio + text combination enhances experience
- Professional UI quality matters for adoption
