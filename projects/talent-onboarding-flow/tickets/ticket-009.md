## Linear Issue
[View in Linear](https://linear.app/metresearch/issue/PON-47/backend-integration-and-supabase-setup)

## Context & Motivation
Implement the complete backend integration with Supabase to enable data persistence, file storage, and email notifications for the talent onboarding system.

## Functional Requirements
- Design and implement Supabase database schema
- Create API endpoints for talent CRUD operations
- Integrate file storage with Supabase Storage
- Implement email notification system with multiple templates
- Connect frontend to backend APIs
- Add data persistence and state management
- Create admin email configuration system
- Implement status change notifications to talent
- Ensure headshots are stored as URLs only (no base64 in database)

## Non-functional Requirements
- Reliable database operations
- Fast API response times
- Secure file storage
- Reliable email delivery
- Scalable architecture
- No large base64 blobs in database

## Success Criteria
- Database schema supports all talent data
- API endpoints handle all CRUD operations
- File storage works reliably with Supabase
- Email notifications are delivered successfully
- Frontend-backend integration is seamless
- Data persistence works across sessions
- Admin email configuration is flexible
- Headshots stored as URLs, base64 handled transiently

## Test Plan
- Test all API endpoints with various data
- Verify database schema supports all requirements
- Test file upload and storage operations
- Validate email notification delivery
- Test frontend-backend integration
- Verify data persistence and state management
- Test admin email configuration
- Verify no base64 data in database

## Dependencies
- Supabase project setup
- Email service integration
- API development framework

## Suggested Implementation Plan
1. Design Supabase database schema (URLs only for media)
2. Create API endpoints for talent operations
3. Integrate Supabase Storage for files
4. Implement email notification system
5. Connect frontend to backend APIs
6. Add data persistence and state management
7. Create admin email configuration
8. Test complete integration
9. Verify no base64 persistence in database

## Effort Estimate
3-4 days

## Priority & Impact
High Priority - Enables production functionality

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Database schema supports all requirements
- [ ] API endpoints handle all operations
- [ ] File storage integration works
- [ ] Email notifications are delivered
- [ ] Frontend-backend integration is complete
- [ ] Data persistence works reliably
- [ ] Admin email configuration is functional
- [ ] No base64 data stored in database
