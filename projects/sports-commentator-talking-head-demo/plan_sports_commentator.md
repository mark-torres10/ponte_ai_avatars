## Resource Allocation

### Development Team
- **Primary Developer**: 1 full-stack developer (4 weeks)
- **Supporting Roles**: 
  - Backend architect consultation
  - Frontend demo preparation expert consultation
  - Rapid prototyping specialist consultation

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Backend Hosting**: Express.js service deployment
- **WebRTC Signaling**: Socket.io server hosting
- **API Access**: ElevenLabs, D-ID, OpenAI accounts
- **Monitoring**: Performance and error tracking

## Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **Audio-Video Synchronization**: Mitigated with timestamp-based strategy and buffer management
