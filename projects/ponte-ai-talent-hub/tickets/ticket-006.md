**Linear Link:** https://linear.app/metresearch/issue/PON-17/deploy-to-vercel-and-final-testing

## Context & Motivation
Deploy the completed application to Vercel and conduct final testing to ensure the MVP is ready for stakeholder access and client demonstrations.

## Functional Requirements
- Deploy to Vercel successfully
- All routes accessible via production URL
- Final testing of all functionality
- Performance optimization
- Production-ready configuration

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Fast loading times
- Reliable deployment
- Production security

## Success Criteria
- App deployed and accessible via Vercel URL
- All routes work correctly in production
- Performance meets expectations
- Ready for stakeholder access
- **Local build passes with `npm run build`**
- **Playwright MCP validates all routes work correctly in production**
- **Playwright MCP confirms all functional requirements work in production**
- **Playwright MCP validates responsive design works in production**
- **Playwright MCP confirms professional appearance suitable for client demos**

## Test Plan
- `test_production_deployment`: App deploys successfully
- `test_all_routes_work`: All 4 routes accessible
- `test_performance`: App loads quickly
- `test_stakeholder_access`: Non-technical users can navigate
- **Playwright MCP validation of all above tests in production environment**

## Dependencies
- Depends on: All previous tickets (PON-12, PON-13, PON-14, PON-15, PON-16)

## Suggested Implementation Plan
- Configure Vercel deployment
- Deploy application
- Test all routes in production
- Optimize performance if needed
- Verify stakeholder accessibility
- **Verify with `npm run build`**
- **Use Playwright MCP to validate all requirements in production**

## Effort Estimate
**1 hour**

## Priority & Impact
- Priority: **High**
- Rationale: Production readiness
