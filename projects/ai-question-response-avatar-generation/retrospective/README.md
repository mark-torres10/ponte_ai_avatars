# Retrospective Directory

This directory contains retrospectives for individual tickets and the overall project.

## Purpose

Retrospectives help us:
- Identify what worked well and what didn't
- Learn from challenges and successes
- Improve our development process
- Document key insights for future projects

## Structure

Each retrospective should include:
- **What Went Well**: Successful aspects of the work
- **What Could Be Improved**: Areas for enhancement
- **Key Learnings**: Important insights and takeaways
- **Action Items**: Specific improvements to implement

## Files

- `README.md` - This overview file
- Future retrospectives will be added here as tickets are completed

## Retrospective Process

1. **Complete the work** and gather feedback
2. **Schedule a retrospective** session
3. **Document insights** using the standard format
