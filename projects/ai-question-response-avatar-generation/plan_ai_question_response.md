# AI Question-to-Response Avatar Generation - Task Plan

## Project Overview
Transform the existing avatar generation flow from script-based input to interactive question-based AI responses, enhancing the demo's interactivity and showcasing AI capabilities.

## Subtasks and Deliverables

### Phase 1: Frontend Component Transformation (4-6 hours)
- **Task 1.1**: Transform TextInput component from script input to question input
  - Deliverable: Modified TextInput component with question input functionality
  - Effort: 2-3 hours
  - Dependencies: None

- **Task 1.2**: Add pre-selected question buttons above text input
  - Deliverable: 4 professional question buttons in 2x2 grid layout
  - Effort: 1-2 hours
  - Dependencies: Task 1.1

- **Task 1.3**: Create AI response display area below text input
  - Deliverable: Read-only text area for displaying AI responses
  - Effort: 1 hour
  - Dependencies: Task 1.1

### Phase 2: Backend API Enhancement (2-3 hours)
- **Task 2.1**: Create new specialized endpoint for persona question responses
  - Deliverable: New endpoint that uses existing generic OpenAI endpoint
  - Effort: 1-2 hours
  - Dependencies: None

- **Task 2.2**: Implement question-to-response prompt engineering
  - Deliverable: Optimized prompts for generating persona-specific responses
  - Effort: 1 hour
  - Dependencies: Task 2.1

### Phase 3: State Management and Integration (2-3 hours)
- **Task 3.1**: Implement new state management for AI responses
  - Deliverable: State flow that handles question → response → voice → video
  - Effort: 1-2 hours
  - Dependencies: Tasks 1.1, 2.1

- **Task 3.2**: Integrate AI responses with existing voice and video generation
  - Deliverable: AI response text flows to ElevenLabs and D-ID integrations
  - Effort: 1 hour
  - Dependencies: Task 3.1

### Phase 4: Testing and Polish (2-3 hours)
- **Task 4.1**: End-to-end flow testing
  - Deliverable: Complete flow testing from question to video generation
  - Effort: 1-2 hours
  - Dependencies: All previous tasks

- **Task 4.2**: Error handling and edge case testing
  - Deliverable: Robust error handling for API failures and edge cases
  - Effort: 1 hour
  - Dependencies: Task 4.1

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
```
TextInput (renamed to QuestionInput)
├── PreSelectedQuestions (4 buttons in 2x2 grid)
├── QuestionInput (textarea for custom questions)
├── AIResponseDisplay (read-only response area)
└── ActionButtons (existing personalization buttons)
```

### State Management
```typescript
interface AvatarGenerationState {
  question: string;
  aiResponse: string | null;
  currentText: string; // This becomes the AI response for voice/video
  isGeneratingResponse: boolean;
  // ... other existing state
}
```

### API Integration
- **Generic Endpoint**: `/api/openai/prompt` (existing)
- **Specialized Endpoint**: `/api/openai/persona-response` (new)
- **Request**: `{ question: string, personaId: string }`
- **Response**: `{ success: boolean, aiResponse: string, personaId: string }`

### UI Flow
1. User selects persona
2. User sees question input interface with pre-selected questions
3. User types custom question or clicks pre-selected one
4. System generates AI response using OpenAI
5. AI response displayed in read-only format
6. AI response text used for voice generation
7. AI response text used for video generation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **State Management Complexity**: Implement clear state flow contracts and comprehensive testing
- **Component Transformation**: Maintain existing component dependencies and interfaces
- **API Reliability**: Implement fallback scenarios and graceful error handling

### Demo Risks
- **OpenAI Failures**: Pre-generate responses for common questions as fallbacks
- **Response Quality**: Implement response validation and quality checks
- **Demo Timing**: Optimize flow to maintain stakeholder engagement

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Users can type custom questions in the text input
- [ ] Pre-selected questions appear as clickable buttons
- [ ] Clicking pre-selected questions overwrites current text input
- [ ] AI generates persona-specific responses to questions
- [ ] Responses are displayed in read-only format
- [ ] AI response text is used for voice generation
- [ ] AI response text is used for video generation
- [ ] All existing functionality continues to work

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Generation**: AI response generation completes within 5-10 seconds
- **UI Responsiveness**: Interface remains responsive during API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures with user-friendly messages

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Existing Systems
- Generic OpenAI endpoint (`/api/openai/prompt`)
- New specialized endpoint for persona responses
- Voice generation (ElevenLabs) integration
- Video generation (D-ID) integration
- Persona selection system
- TextInput component

### External Dependencies
- OpenAI API access and reliability
- Existing backend infrastructure
- Frontend build system and dependencies

## Timeline and Milestones

### Week 1: Frontend Development
- Complete Phase 1 (Component Transformation)
- Begin Phase 2 (Backend Enhancement)

### Week 2: Backend and Integration
- Complete Phase 2 (Backend Enhancement)
- Complete Phase 3 (State Management and Integration)

### Week 3: Testing and Deployment
- Complete Phase 4 (Testing and Polish)

## Total Effort Estimate
**Total Hours**: 10-15 hours (including buffer for unexpected challenges)
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Risk Level**: Medium (due to state management complexity and API dependencies)
