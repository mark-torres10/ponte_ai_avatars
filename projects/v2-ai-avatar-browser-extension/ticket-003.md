# PON-83: AI Avatar Commentary Generation with OpenAI Integration - Detailed Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

**Ticket**: PON-83 - AI Avatar Commentary Generation with OpenAI Integration  
**Scope**: Implement OpenAI-powered sports commentary generation for the AI Avatar browser extension  
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours focused implementation  
**Goal**: Create a complete AI commentary system that generates contextual sports analysis when users click the avatar on ESPN NBA boxscore pages

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURE NOTE**: This implementation uses a temporary frontend-only approach with OpenAI API calls directly from the browser extension. This is for rapid prototyping and demo purposes only. In production, all AI services (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.) should be moved to a secure backend service to protect API keys and improve security. The current approach prioritizes speed of delivery over production readiness.

## Current State Analysis

### **What Already Exists**
- ✅ ESPN page detection and team extraction (PON-82)
- ✅ Avatar placeholder with click handler
- ✅ Enhanced game data extraction (scores, venue, time, etc.)
- ✅ Extension foundation and build system
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for data structures

### **What Needs Implementation**
- ❌ OpenAI API integration for commentary generation
- ❌ Commentary display UI overlay
- ❌ User interaction flow (click → generate → display)
- ❌ Error handling and fallback content
- ❌ Environment configuration for API keys

## Detailed Implementation Plan with Enhanced Verification

### **Phase 1: Environment Setup & Configuration (30 minutes)** ✅ **COMPLETED**

#### **Step 1: Create Environment Configuration**
**Implementation**: Create `.env` file and update `.gitignore`

**Automated Tests**:
```typescript
describe('Environment Configuration', () => {
  test('should load OpenAI API key from environment', () => {
    // Mock environment variables
    process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = 'test-key';
    const config = loadEnvironmentConfig();
    expect(config.openaiApiKey).toBe('test-key');
  });
  
  test('should load ElevenLabs API key from environment', () => {
    process.env.ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = 'test-elevenlabs-key';
    const config = loadEnvironmentConfig();
    expect(config.elevenlabsApiKey).toBe('test-elevenlabs-key');
  });
  
  test('should load Parker Munns voice ID from environment', () => {
    process.env.ELEVENLABS_PARKER_MUNNS_VOICE_ID = 'test-voice-id';
    const config = loadEnvironmentConfig();
    expect(config.parkerMunnsVoiceId).toBe('test-voice-id');
  });
  
  test('should handle missing API keys gracefully', () => {
    delete process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
    const config = loadEnvironmentConfig();
    expect(config.openaiApiKey).toBeUndefined();
  });
});
```

**Manual Verification Steps**:
1. **Create .env file**
   - Navigate to `ai-avatar-extension/` directory in terminal
   - Create `.env` file: `touch .env`
   - Add the following content to `.env`:
           ```
      OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
      ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
      ELEVENLABS_PARKER_MUNNS_VOICE_ID=your_parker_munns_voice_id_here
      ```
      
      **Note**: The actual API keys are available in the backend `.env` file. Copy them from there or ask the development team for the current values.
   - Verify file is created: `ls -la .env` should show the file
   
2. **Update .gitignore**
   - Open `.gitignore` file in `ai-avatar-extension/` directory
   - Verify `.env` is listed (if not, add it)
   - Run: `cat .gitignore | grep .env` should show `.env`
   
3. **Verify Build Success**
   - Run: `npm run build` in `ai-avatar-extension/` directory
   - Should complete without errors
   - Console should show: `"Build completed successfully"`
   - No TypeScript compilation errors should appear

#### **Step 2: Install OpenAI Dependencies**
**Implementation**: Add OpenAI SDK to package.json

**Automated Tests**:
```typescript
describe('OpenAI Dependencies', () => {
  test('should have OpenAI package available', () => {
    const openai = require('openai');
    expect(openai).toBeDefined();
  });
  
  test('should have proper package version', () => {
    const packageJson = require('../package.json');
    expect(packageJson.dependencies.openai).toBeDefined();
    expect(packageJson.dependencies.openai).toMatch(/^\^4\./);
  });
});
```

**Manual Verification Steps**:
1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run: `npm install openai` in `ai-avatar-extension/` directory
   - Wait for installation to complete
   - Verify: `package.json` shows `"openai": "^4.x.x"` in dependencies
   
2. **Verify Installation**
   - Check: `node_modules/openai/` directory exists
   - Run: `ls node_modules/openai/` should show package contents
   - Run: `npm run build` - should succeed without errors
   - Console should show: `"Dependencies installed successfully"`
