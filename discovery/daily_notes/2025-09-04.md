8:50am: I think that I can make the individual shots via Veo3, stitch them together, and then add ElevenLabs audio on top after.

11:02am: I'm wrapping up figuring out a creative production guide. I'll read through that, and then I'll pass in the good examples that I found on Twitter and create a set of prompts that'll allow me to create similar-quality prompts but for specific shots that I have in mind.

Then once I do that, I can pass those to Veo3 (and for any specific pictures that I want to use, I can edit with Nano Banana), iterate, and then stitch together each shot after the fact with CapCut or something (or I could make use of that video editing software that I tried to combine before with HeyGen, I forget what it's called).

6:00pm: Setting up prompts now for what makes a good video prompt, then I'll create the equivalent of "PROJECT_PLANNING_EXECUTION.md" but for the production stuff.

6:41pm: OK, created the initial AI instructions for how to create these prompts. Then I'll actually run it through the Ponte AI workflows.

7:12pm: OK, creating the personas now and then created the workflow. Next I'll actually start doing it but for the Ponte AI task.

7:36pm: OK, personas done. Now I can start creating the actual prompts.

8:25pm: Running this now, generating the shots and workflow to actually do this.
